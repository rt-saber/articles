Have you dreamed of a remote shell with the stealth of a custom in-memory
implant and the comfort of a shell running on your local host? Dream no
more, comrade – enjoy this exhaustive discussion of such a tool.


                             Introduction
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~

Attackers consider remote shells a foundational element of the attack
development lifecycle because they allow us to carry out operations on a
victim machine. Yet, the "market" for remote shell implementations is
rather stale and stagnant, with vendors offering proprietary tools and
everyone else building custom ones or binding standard in/out/error to a
remote socket before execing the system shell.

Traditional post-exploitation toolchains are either noisy and flexible,
or stealthy and cumbersome. But stealthy remote code execution need not
be unwieldy and slow to operationalize. By rethinking what the "remote"
in remote shell means, we can make shelling into exploited systems much
more difficult to detect.

This paper scrutinizes the remote shell status quo, describes a new class
of shell to simplify target puppetry, and traverses the syscall hells
along the way.


                 What is a remote interactive shell?
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An interactive shell is a prompt that accepts textual commands as input
from a user and acknowledges the output to the user. Prior to the
popularization of graphical interfaces, shells were the primary mechanism
for users to interact with their computers and still are for many people
of software. Those of us old enough to use DOS may remember the
C:\> prompt fondly, and those older than I may remember earlier ones.

Choice of shell is often personal to those who interact with computers
over extended periods, and experienced hackers customize their shells
with custom prompts, aliases, and scripts.

A *remote* interactive shell performs our commands over a network on
another computer instead of the one we're physically interacting with.
SSH is the canonical tool for legitimate remote interactive shells.

A classic approach is to write an exploit that creates a new socket,
connects to a predefined network address (where we're already listening),
then binds that new socket to standard input and output. After we bind it,
we exec the system's shell interpreter – replacing the service we
exploited (like nginx) with a shell under our control. We call this a
"connectback" shell because the exploit connects back to us.

Alternatively, we could reuse an existing socket (rather than creating a
new socket); we can choose the same socket we used to exploit the target
to maximize our convenience. With this approach, we write our exploit to
bind standard input and output to the existing network socket and exec the
system's shell interpreter. This is creatively known as a "socket reuse"
shell.

Yet another approach involves writing an exploit that launches an implant 
– a bit of software that exists only to receive and perform commands
over a network socket – as well as building a custom interactive prompt
that accepts commands from us locally (which we send over the network to
the implant). This approach avoids running a shell on the victim's
infrastructure, but is cumbersome and requires anticipating which
commands we might need ahead of time.


                 Why do attackers use remote shells?
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am making the generous assumption that Phrack's audience still consists
of offense-minded folks – i.e., "attackers" – rather than middle-aged
exploit authors who sold out to enrich venture capitalists. So, when I
say, "we," assume our jolly group includes attack-oriented programmers.

When we exploit a vulnerability in a target system, remote shells allow us
to interact with the victim's system and spare us from pre-emptively
defining exactly which tasks we want to perform (when we don't even know
much about the system). For this reason, we often spawn shells during the
exploitation phase of our operations. Interactive prompts make us more
nimble; if we realize we need to do something we hadn't anticipated, we
aren't forced to re-exploit the system with a new payload (which is both
annoying and possibly expensive).

Just as legitimate system administrators often need to log into their
systems and explore them interactively, we will need to explore the
systems under our purview interactively as surprise system administrators.


           The disparate hemispheres in traditional shells
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Classic connectback or socket reuse shells only give us access to whatever
packages and tools are on the victim's machine already, in whatever
configuration that system's operator decided. Custom interactive prompts
that communicate with a hand-crafted implant are brittle and make us
reinvent an interactive environment from scratch.

Like most people of software, I heavily customize my environment and do
not like the interactive prompts available for Windows. I am also a lazy
attacker. I refuse the indignity of Powershell and cling to the Linux
utilities burned into my brain, so much so that I descended into a
labyrinthian rabbit hole and traversed the bowels of Linux, macOS, and
Windows for an unreasonable hoard of hours to create my own toolchain and
indulge my persnickety laziness.

You deserve a more civilized attack workflow, too. Let's discuss this
extravagant contraption in detail.


                           Stealth Shell
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stealth shell tooling simplifies how we interact with remote victim
systems while muffling any side effects to elude discovery by defenders.
It not only improves the interactive experience of remote shells, but
veils their activity like custom in-memory exploits (without the
inconvenience of a custom non-standard interactive environment or worse,
being limited to the preordained shellcode we crafted during the
operation's initial stages).

What qualities constitute a tool capable of creating stealth shells? There
are three key criteria a tool must satisfy:

1. Unify the computational resources of multiple machines as if they were
   one system

2. Expose access to this system via a standard shell interface that can
   run arbitrary programs

3. Hide execution inside an in-memory implant to avoid detection

How does this innovate beyond existing commercial tools like Immunity
Canvas and Core Impact? Those are special, proprietary tools with their
own proprietary ecosystems that you have to buy; any extensions you build
are locked into those walled ecosystems. They also don't do anything to
unify multiple machines under a single illusion; they force you to
explicitly talk to the remote machine using their proprietary
commands and APIs.

A stealth shell is special because the way you interact with it is not
special. It reifies a regular Linux shell so we can use standard UNIX
tools to puppeteer our target machines. This simplifies our workflow to:

1. Discover vulnerable target service

2. Exploit the target service (bring your own vulnerability),
   instantiating the stealth shell implant

3. Interact with the target system as if it were local using the virtual
   stealth shell:

   ~* Finding their cyberinsurance policy is as simple as grep; *~
   ~* Copying the victim's files is as simple as running cp; *~
   ~* Querying their databases is as simple as running psql; *~
   ~* Adding a backdoor ssh key is as simple as writing to the target's
      .ssh/authorized_keys file; *~
   ~* Fetching data from other services is as simple as running curl; *~
   ~* Imaging their disk is as simple as dd; *~
   ~* Exfiltrating data is as simple as rsync; *~
   ~* Computing SHA256 hashes using their CPU is as simple as running
      xmrig; *~

A stealth shell can access all the packages installed on our machine. It
respects our local configuration, line discipline, and window sizing. We
can use our favorite scripting languages to automate operations against
the victim's machine rather than gluing random snippets of shellcode
together by hand.

At the highest level, the stealth shell collection of tools contain a
fully virtualized attack toolchain. They virtualize the filesystem,
network, and compute resources of both the remote victim system and our
local system, transmogrifying these disparate hemispheres into a unified,
distributed Linux machine at our disposal.

This unified, distributed Linux machine lives in the initial shell process
and any subsequent subprocesses we spawn when interacting with the shell.
We can execute these subprocesses locally or embed them on our victim's
machine via the implant; Stealth shells bequeath us equal access to files
and network connections on either hemisphere of the distributed system
(i.e. both our machine as an attacker and our target / victim machine).


                 System call remoting with an implant
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How is it possible for us to command both our system and our victim's as
if they were one distributed Linux machine? We employ the age-old
technique of system call remoting (publicized and later commercialized by
CORE). On whatever machine we're using to mount our attack operation, we
run programs locally but proxy our commands over the network to the target
(victim) machines so our implant executes them instead.

This makes an implant the first critical ingredient we need for syscall
remoting. A stealth shell's implant is lightweight, performing only a few
necessary behaviors. On start, the implant searches for the incoming
socket (the one that triggered the exploit). It next reuses that socket
and sends a hello message to us (on our local machine) indicating the
exploit succeeded. The implant then attentively listens (in a loop) for
when we send it commands to perform.

Stealth shell's implant accepts the following commands:

1. Perform a syscall and report the result back
2. Call a function and report the result back
3. Peek at a range of memory and report the bytes back
4. Poke at a range of memory, writing a specific sequence of bytes into it

Stealth shell uses these commands to perform operations on our behalf.
Let's say we type `stat /target/etc/passwd` into the stealth shell on our
local machine. On the remote victim machine, the implant performs a
newfstatat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/passwd", ..., AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW) syscall and
dutifully reports back that yes, it did find a passwd file and shows us
the file's attributes.

Similarly, let's say we type `cat /target/etc/passwd` into the stealth
shell. This will have the implant perform openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/passwd",
O_RDONLY) followed by a series of read syscalls on the resulting remote
file descriptor. cat will then print the contents of the remote file to
the terminal.

This is all the support we need from the implant to support a stealth
shell for syscall remoting.


                  Intercepting local syscall operations
                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Great! We exploited a given target, then installed the implant that reuses
the victim socket and listens for commands to perform on the (remote)
victim machine. But how do we interact with the victim's remote machine as
if it were our local machine? How can we ensure the commands we enter on
our local machine execute on our victim's remote machine? We need
something that can tell the implant what to do based on what we type into
our local shell. Specifically, we need a component on our machine that
intercepts local syscall requests and instead sends them over the network
for the implant to execute on the victim's system.

To understand how syscall interception works, let's start with "typical"
syscall behavior. How do syscalls normally work when we aren't
manipulating them for crimes, espionage, or escapades? When a process
performs a syscall, the operating system wakes up and its kernel figures
out what operation is associated with the syscall. The kernel performs
the operation on the process and then resumes executing the program.
The program continues doing work, relying on the operation it asked the
kernel to perform.

If we can somehow direct the kernel to hand control over to us, we can
replace the behavior of the operating system with behaviors of our own.

Enter axon, the monitor component that intercepts syscalls in my
implementation of stealth shell. When the kernel receives a syscall from
a process, rather than determining and executing the appropriate
operation, it instead switches to axon and tells it (roughly), "hey, the
program asked me to perform this syscall operation, but you told me to
deliver these requests to you, so now it's your responsibility and I'm not
going to do anything more with the syscall." axon is now the anointed
entity that figures out what to do and when to resume the program.

How do we, the attacker, interact with axon? When we try to interact with
a remote resource via a program we're running in the shell (say, for
example, `cat /target/etc/passwd`), doing whatever we want to do, axon
interrupts the shell, packages the program's request (in this case,
open "/etc/passwd") into a message, sends the message to the implant, and
waits for the implant's response. Once it receives the implant's response
(like "hello here is a file descriptor number representing the file you
asked me to open"), axon resumes our shell – and our shell then continues
with the next step of the program (like cat, which will immediately try to
read the bytes in the file).

Let's inspect each of these steps to see how axon makes this happen.

axon waits on our host (i.e. our local machine) for the implant's hello
message. When it receives the hello message, axon knows the exploit
succeeded and the implant is ready to receive commands. Axon spawns a
subprocess and asks the kernel to deliver all syscall attempts from the
subprocess to axon. Inside the local subprocess, it execs bash, which will
become our running stealth shell. bash begins its normal startup process,
executing as intended… until it tries to perform a syscall.

This (local) bash process tries to perform a syscall operation by sending
its request to the local kernel – but the kernel instead is like, "hold up,
I gotta hand this over to my new bff axon so they can figure out what to
do with it."
In more technical terms, the kernel traps bash's attempt to perform a
syscall operation and delivers the trap to axon as a signal. axon examines
the syscall request described in the signal and inspects its arguments to
decide how to process the syscall.

If the syscall references a path, file descriptor, or network address,
axon must select whether it's a local or remote operation – that is,
whether the implant on the remote victim machine should perform the
operation or if our local machine should instead. The syscall request
itself indicates when commands should be performed on the target (i.e.
remote victim machine) by one of:

1. A path beginning with the /target/ prefix
2. A relative path referencing files out of /target
3. A network address in the virtual target address range
4. A file descriptor the shell process previously opened against a remote
   path or network address

We can therefore think of axon as a syscall dispatcher. It examines the
incoming syscalls and, based on their arguments, appropriately routes them
to the host bearing the associated resource.

For example, if we run `stat /etc/hostname`, axon determines that
/etc/hostname is a local path and performs our stat operation locally.
If instead we run `stat /target/etc/passwd`, axon determines that
/target/etc/passwd is a remote path and runs a stat /etc/passwd operation
remotely by asking the implant to perform the operation on our behalf.
This orchestration powers our distributed system.

Let's go a layer deeper, starting with local operations (since that
reflects the simpler path axon can take). If the syscall request doesn't
have any of the indicators of a remote resource described above, axon
calls back into the kernel and requests the exact same syscall operation
the subprocess initially requested. When the syscall completes, axon
delivers the results to the subprocess and resumes the subprocess's
execution. In replaying the syscall request it received, axon behaves as
a "manipulator in the middle" between the running shell process and our
local kernel.

What if we ask the shell to interact by specifying one of the "plz perform
on the victim machine" indicators? For remote operations, axon translates
the resulting syscall operation to the equivalent command the implant
should execute on the target – and respects compatibility with the
target's operating system (like translating a Linux open syscall to
a Windows CreateFileEx function call). axon then serializes this
translated command into a sequence of bytes representing it, sends the
serialized bytes over the network socket (the socket shared with the
implant), and waits for the implant to send a response indicating it
executed the command.

axon's message wakes the remote implant running on our target (it rests in
an idle state while awaiting our signal to perform some remote
operations). The implant accepts axon's serialized bytes, deserializes our
command into a local buffer, and performs axon's requested syscall. When
the syscall completes, the implant serializes the result – including any
mutated data – into a sequence of bytes representing it. It then sends
these serialized bytes back over the network as a response to axon, before
waiting for further commands to perform.

Upon receipt, axon first deserializes the response into its constituent
components; for example, a response to a read request will include the
status of the read syscall, as well as whatever bytes the implant read.
Then axon writes any updated data into the subprocess' address space and
resumes the bash subprocess, awaiting our additional commands (i.e.
syscall requests).

With axon dispatching our commands across the network and the remote
implant executing them on the victim's machine, we've covered the basics
of syscall remoting. To summarize, we can manipulate the target's file and
disk as if they were local files via syscall interception and the implant.
We can remotely puppeteer the victim's system using our local (Linux)
processes. (In practice, we are subject to many fiddly details since axon
must coordinate the simultaneous execution of multiple subprocesses that
each possess distinct emulated file descriptor tables.)

We can now treat the remote (victim) system like it's part of our local
system; we can restore our dignity when targeting Windows or macOS
machines by automagically translating our Linux commands into these
foreign tongues. Is that enough? To reasonable people, yes. But we are
not reasonable people, are we? We need to treat *both* sides as a unified
distributed system to realize the more civilized world of Linux everything
everywhere all at once.

Let's now discuss how a stealth shell does just that.


              ti esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup I
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section has the same basic goals as the prior section and shares much
of the same approach, but runs it backwards and is more extra. Why would
we do this? Because sometimes we want to do crimes on the victim's machine
but do the not-crimes on our local machine, like loading libraries or
writing log messages to our local disk. The more we can do stuff on our
local machine, the more we slink past the defender's gaze.

Consider a crime like cryptomining on the victim's machine. We could:

1. adjust xmrig to be in a big block of shellcode containing all of its
   libraries and configuration

2. turn off all its logging

3. have it proxy its network activity through the socket connecting the
   victim and us

4. and mask off any other feature that might lead to our discovery

That is a lot of fiddly, manual work and it would be disastrously easy to
slip up – like it writing files onto the victim's disk, trying to activate
a GPU the victim doesn't have, or making bitcoin network requests that the
victim's security stack should trivially detect. Remember, we are
engineers. Like any decent engineer, we should spare ourselves of this
tedious labor by wormholing into building tools to handle this
automatically instead. And that's precisely what I did.

How can we transplant some of the target operations back to our local
machine to suppress noisy side effects? A stealth shell takes the same
mechanism that remotes syscalls and applies it in reverse, executing
programs inside the remote implant. We call these embedded running
programs "picoprocesses" because they're regular Linux programs that each
think they're running as a Linux process, when actually they're embedded
in the implant running inside another process. These picoprocesses even
think they are regular Linux processes when they're running on Windows
or macOS.

Are these real processes? What is real? To them they are.
How can picoprocesses be real if our eyes aren't real?

texec is our stealth shell's mechanism for executing entire programs
remotely on the victim's computer (loading them inside the implant);
texec is short for "target exec" because it execs a program on the
target. To picoprocesses, the previous rules about what is local and what
is remote are flipped – paths prefixed with /target/ reference local
files, with any remaining paths referencing remote files living on our
system. This lets programs running as picoprocesses send commands back to
our local system so texec (which runs locally on our machine) can
perform them.

Note that this also means the target could manipulate our machine if they
discover our presence in their systems. In the spirit of Secure by Design,
stealth shell makes you opt in by prefixing your commands with our helper
program `texec`. (The reference implementation also does some things not
described here to detect and limit the effects of target tampering; we
recommend carrying out your operations from heavily sandboxed
environments).

But that addressable hazard aside, it's just as straightforward for us to
run the same syscall interception activities with the roles reversed. Let's
explore how.


                      Offloading syscalls with texec
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How do we intercept syscalls the picoprocess performs without alerting
defenders (or, more realistically, SREs) to our presence? To remain
concealed, the implant shouldn't launch new processes and shouldn't
perform bizarre operations the exploited program wouldn't perform, like
attaching a seccomp trap, ptracing a peer thread, or opening /dev/kvm.
These options aren't available when the target is Windows or macOS anyway.

Prepare for a journey, because performing these functions under such a
restrictive regime requires rather lavish resourcefulness.

With axon, we intercepted syscall events by asking the OS to deliver them
to us rather than letting the kernel execute them by default; we
automatically routed syscalls referencing /target to the implant on the
victim machine (to execute remotely) and let axon handle the other
syscalls on our machine (to execute locally).

texec takes a different approach to syscall interception: texec creates a
virtual remote process by puppeteering the implant into creating and
subsequently executing a Linux program inside the implant's address space
as a picoprocess. texec analyzes programs just-in-time as we request them
and replaces any syscall instructions with a jump to its own handler that
emulates the syscall. In contrast to axon, texec sends any syscalls
referencing /target to the implant (to execute *locally*) and the rest to
texec running on our machine (to execute *remotely*).

Let's tease out this trick, starting with the initial stages of remote
program execution.

texec begins by mapping a small runtime into the target's address space.
It requests the implant call mmap or VirtualAllocEx to reserve some memory
for the runtime and pokes the runtime's contents into memory. The runtime
includes all the facilities texec needs to receive syscall requests,
dispatch syscalls remotely to the attacker's host (a reversal of axon's
role), dispatch them locally on the victim's machine, and manage a virtual
file descriptor table.

With the runtime mapped into the victim process' memory, texec proceeds to
the next phase: running our naughty program of choice inside the implant.
For example, if we enter `texec /bin/xmrig`, we want texec to run the
xmrig binary on the target so we can convert the victim's computational
resources into coins. texec first resolves and maps the main binary into
local memory, then pokes it into remote memory by calling mmap or
VirtualAllocEx again. If the main binary requires an ELF interpreter,
as most do, texec maps the interpreter into memory, too.

Once texec loads our binaries in local memory and in the remote implant,
it just-in-time analyzes the local copy of the binaries' .text sections
for syscall instructions. x86_64 systems represent syscall instructions
with the two-byte "0f 05" sequence. For each syscall instruction texec
encounters, it prepares a detours-style patch by analyzing the
nearby instructions and relocating enough of them to insert
a jmp (e8 xx xx xx xx) instruction.

texec replaces (i.e. "patches") each relocated syscall instruction with a
jump to a trampoline containing:

1. relocated instructions from before the original syscall instruction
2. instructions that spill and restore the syscall arguments
3. a call into the runtime texec mapped earlier
4. any relocated instructions from after the original syscall instruction
5. and a jump back to the original instruction sequence.

Here's the stencil for the trampoline:
</PRE>
```asm
# relocated prefix instructions
{relocated_prefix}
# save syscall number
mov %rax, %r11
# save flags
lahf
seto %al
# skip red zone
sub $128, %rsp
# spill registers to stack
push %rax
push %r9
push %r8
push %r10
push %rdx
push %rsi
push %rdi
push %r11
# move address of spilled registers into first arg
mov %rsp, %rdi
# call the runtime's syscall handler
movabs ${runtime handler address}, %rcx
call *%rcx
# restore registers from stack
pop %rcx
pop %rdi
pop %rsi
pop %rdx
pop %r10
pop %r8
pop %r9
pop %rax
# restore previous stack
add $128, %rsp
# restore flags
add $0xff, %al
sahf
# move result into rax
mov %rcx, %rax
# relocated suffix instructions
{relocated_suffix}
# resume patched function
jmp {resume_address}
```
<PRE>

Once texec prepares all the patches for the program's syscall
instructions, it remotely pokes each patch into place via the implant.
It also must correct each segment's memory protection so the victim's
system will allow the instructions to execute on the victim's CPU; for
the parts of the picoprocess that contain instructions, texec marks them
as executable.

With that final step of poking patches into memory (and ensuring the
patched instructions can execute), we've tampered with the binary,
replacing its syscall instructions with jumps to trampolines. But we still
need to launch the picoprocess to achieve the dream of running a Linux
program inside the implant.

For these last few steps before the picoprocess launches, texec constructs
a main thread stack for the picoprocess by commanding the implant call
mmap or CreateThread.

To match what the Linux kernel would do when executing a new program,
the stack needs a description of the arguments and environment variables
to launch the picoprocess with. This data's format is called a System V
auxiliary vector. texec crafts a SysV auxiliary vector mimicking what a
real Linux kernel would produce when executing a program, and pokes
the vector into the remote stack it just created.

The last step before launch has texec command the implant to perform a
clone syscall or call ResumeThread to start executing the remotely loaded
program. The picoprocess now runs in the implant as an embedded thread.
Anyone examining the target system in ps, top, or Task Manager would only
see an additional thread on the existing process – no suspicious
subprocesses, binaries on disk, or program names. texec then waits for
commands from the remote picoprocess (running on the victim's machine),
just as the implant awaits our local commands.

Meanwhile, the picoprocess runs inside of the implant as a dedicated
thread, executing until it reaches its first patched (i.e. replaced)
syscall instruction. Remember, we tampered with the syscall instructions
so the picoprocess jumps to texec's handler instead. This means that,
instead of attempting a syscall, the picoprocess jumps to the designated
trampoline and calls the runtime's syscall handler to process what would
have been a syscall operation. The runtime determines whether to emulate
the program's syscall request locally or perform it remotely (on our
machine) by serializing the syscall's arguments, then sends the serialized
syscall across the network to the texec process waiting on our machine –
similar to what axon performs in the other direction.

The runtime's message wakes the texec running on our machine (it rests
in an idle state while awaiting our signal to perform some remote
operations). texec accepts the runtime's serialized bytes, reads our
command into a local buffer, and performs the runtime's requested
syscall. When the syscall completes, the texec serializes the result –
including any mutated data – into a network representation. It then sends
this serialized representation back over the network as a response to the
runtime before waiting for further commands to perform.

Upon receipt, the runtime first deserializes the response into its
constituent components; for example, a response to a read request will
include the status of the read syscall, as well as whatever bytes
the implant read. Then the runtime writes any updated data into the
picoprocess's address space and returns into the trampoline to resume the
picoprocess, awaiting its additional commands (i.e. syscall requests).

This may sound familiar — it's the exact series of events as earlier
when we discussed axon, but reversing the direction of traffic across the
network socket.

Now that texec can load programs remotely and process their syscall
requests, we can run programs and access either side's data on both
"hemispheres" of our unified distributed system. With the implant + axon +
texec + texec's runtime, we can access our local and our victim's remote
resources and command them as we please. We have one distributed system
spread across a network, hidden from the victim system's operator.


                          Multi-platform support
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We've definitely skimmed over multi-OS support as if it were trivial until
this point. As foreshadowed, we must translate Linux syscalls into the
remote system's OS interface if we want to target multiple operating
systems. Executives don't seem to care about hacks unless they're on a
machine they use – which is almost always Windows – so our tooling doesn't
suffice until we support the big three.

What do we need to support each major OS?

Linux targets are straightforward: the target shares the same syscall
interface, though potentially an older version with fewer features.
Enterprises tend to run older LTS systems. The only hazard we face is
copying input and output data correctly.

macOS targets have many syscalls similar to Linux, albeit with different
numeric IDs and calling conventions. Some Linux syscalls, however, have
different data layouts in their macOS equivalent or are simply
unavailable. To remotely perform a macOS syscall, a stealth shell must
translate between the two ABIs.

For Windows targets, the entire API is different; the design distinctly
differs from UNIX operating systems. CreateFileEx is similar to open,
and the HANDLEs it produces can be thought of as file descriptors by
another name, but all the other syscalls stymie direct translation.
If you want to extend stealth shell support to Windows targets, be
prepared to invest heavily into your Windows translation layer. It took
a hundred or so hours as a humble software engineer, so surely your leet
attack team can build it without sacrificing their sanity in the pursuit
of perfection. Perhaps read cygwin for inspiration.


                               Conclusion
                               ~~~~~~~~~~

Stealth shells make remote interactive shells even more flexible while
remaining as perniciously sneaky as custom in-memory exploits. There is
no tradeoff: we can be both quiet and nimble. It extends the practice of
syscall remoting so we can enjoy the comfort and familiarity of the Linux
ecosystem while maximizing pwnage possibilities on target systems,
regardless of OS.

Our stealth shell uses an implant and two interrelated syscall
dispatchers – axon and texec – to interrupt syscalls and redirect them
for execution on the appropriate resource (either the victim's machine or
our own). axon coordinates and dispatches the syscall activity of a tree
of subprocesses, bridging two systems together into one interactive
environment and minimizing side effects on the victim's system. texec
instantiates and coordinates the activity of a remote picoprocess,
converting regular Linux programs into spooky execution at a distance.

Stealth shells are just as cloaked to defenders as vastly more cumbersome
custom in-memory exploits (and are certainly as sneaky as prior syscall
remoting approaches). If a hyperfocused SRE can detect an in-memory
implant, they can detect stealth shell's in-memory implant. If they can
detect an in-memory implant loading new/more code, they can detect texec
loading a picoprocess.

With that said, we can layer a stealth shell with other evasive
techniques – such as tunneling through DNS, reusing an existing socket,
and, with additional effort, mimicking an existing protocol like HTTP.
We will leave that as an exercise for the reader.

Exploits get most of the hype, but toolchains and workflows are what make
or break real attack operations. Plus, we deserve civilized workflows that
don't require us to cosplay as Windows sysadmin. I hope this inspires other
obsessive systems nerds to brainstorm what other tools need a refresh to
ferry them into the modern ops era.
