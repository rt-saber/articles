----|  1. Introduction

    Return Oriented Programming (ROP) has been around for over 15 years 
now [1]. Since then, other code reuse techniques have been demonstrated 
to work in certain circumstances, such as Jump Oriented Programming (JOP) 
[2][3]. With the growth of these two techniques in the last decade, new 
protections have been created to limit their usability. Some of these 
include Control-Flow Enforcement Technology (CET) [4] for Intel processors 
and Pointer Authentication (PAC) and Branch Target Identification (BTI) 
[5][6] for ARM processors. The intent of these protections is to limit 
the use of code reuse attacks such as ROP and JOP within a program.

CET encompasses two primary protective measures: the Shadow Stack and 
Indirect Branch Targeting (IBT) [7]. The Shadow Stack, a secondary 
hardware stack, primarily records return addresses to verify the integrity 
of the return path's control flow. While alternative methods to manipulate 
values within this secondary stack do exist, the primary safeguard lies in 
inspecting returns, thereby constraining ROP in scenarios such as stack 
buffer overflows or stack pivots. 

IBT involves the direct enforcement of specific landing destinations for 
indirect branches, whether they are register or memory jump/call 
instructions. Although the landing pad instruction necessary for IBT has 
been incorporated since GCC 8 [8], its full integration into the Linux 
system was only recently finalized [9]. Typically placed at the beginning 
of functions susceptible to indirect referencing, this landing pad 
directive serves as a safeguard. In Intel processors this landing pad 
instruction is `ENDBR64`. Should an indirect jump or call fail to land on 
the specified instruction, a trap is triggered. This protective measure 
aims to mitigate the effectiveness of JOP attacks.

Regarding ARM protections, we have PAC/BTI [6]. PAC involves applying a
lightweight hashing protection to a memory value, typically pointers, 
although it can be applied to almost any value. This process entails 
storing the hashed value within the unused topmost bits of the pointer. 
Given that userspace applications generally utilize no more than 48 bits 
of the available 64-bit address space, this approach is feasible. 

It can be easily implemented with a few instructions at both the beginning 
and end of a function to safeguard return addresses. While it can also 
serve to verify against other forms of memory corruption, it's not yet 
commonplace in Linux to fully validate every potential function pointer 
(a point of consideration for future developments).

The second safeguard, BTI, mirrors IBT in functionality, albeit with 
slightly different terminology. Like IBT, it involves placing a landing 
pad instruction at the onset of functions to protect against JOP attacks 
stemming from indirect branches. In ARM processors this landing pad 
instruction is aptly named `BTI`.

Given that both processor types (Intel, ARM) incorporate two primary
techniques aimed at mitigating code reuse attacks such as ROP and JOP,
leveraging these techniques to exploit a memory corruption vulnerability
becomes a daunting task, if not nearly impossible. Instead of attempting 
to bypass these safeguards, why not utilize them in accordance with their 
original design? This approach can be achieved through Function Oriented
Programming (FOP).


----|  2. FOP Background

    Ah, indeed, let's clarify: FOP diverges from the realm of Functional
Programming paradigms, so aficionados of Haskell need not fret; they will 
not find solace here. FOP, or Functional Oriented Programming, involves 
employing an entire function (from its prologue to its epilogue) as a 
gadget. Unlike the traditional notion of "gadgets" in ROP or JOP 
scenarios, which typically consist of just a few instructions, such as 
the classic "POP RDI; RET;", FOP extends gadgets to encompass entire 
functions.

The purpose of utilizing the entire function as the gadget is to leverage 
two abilities from functions. The first is the ability to utilize a 
function as intended. An example would be that by controlling two 
parameters of a function call, such as strcpy, it becomes possible to 
manipulate values in memory. This may seem like a small feat, but this 
could be expanded to any function that includes a starting landing pad 
instruction in Glibc, such as `mprotect` or `syscall`. 

The second ability is gained by the side effects that occur from calling 
a function. As parameter registers are usually considered volatile, there 
is no value in restoring or protecting them. This results in parameter 
register values to potentially be of use after a function call. 

An example of this can be found in the Glibc internal function 
`__hash_string`, and is used in the examples in Appendix B. This function 
is normally used to create a hash of a string for lookup operations, 
taking the string as the first argument through the RDI register. This 
function has the unintended consequence of moving the RDI register to 
point to the first null byte in memory, if RDI points to a valid address. 

This is compiler and architecture dependent, but has been observed to be 
fairly consistent across several Libc versions. While the intention of 
this function is to return a hash of a string, an attacker can use this 
to increment RDI to the end of a memory segment. Chaining similar side 
effects together can then result in further modifications of registers 
or values in memory. 

The abilities described are dependent on a reliable dispatcher gadget. In 
the aforementioned example, the dispatcher must not modify the volatile 
argument registers between FOP gadget calls. This paper examines such a 
dispatcher that is found normally within Glibc, and is called within 
normal execution. Because the dispatcher's function call takes no 
parameters, the parameter registers are not reset between calls. This 
allows the next FOP gadget to use the parameter registers set by the 
previous call. Using a memory corruption vulnerability and this 
dispatcher, it becomes possible to build a FOP chain to gain execution.

While FOP isn't an entirely novel technique, this paper endeavors to shed
light on its potential impact on modern systems. The concept of employing
entire functions as gadgets found its initial implementation in 2011 [10]. 
The primary revelation was the ability to chain multiple Return-Into-Libc
functions on the stack, thereby achieving Turing-complete functionality. 
This concept underwent refinement, leading to the emergence of Loop 
Oriented Programming (LOP) in 2015 [11]. LOP showcased the utilization of 
function chaining with a loop gadget serving as a dispatcher. 
Subsequently, in 2018, this evolved into FOP [12].

FOP shares similarities with Counterfeit Object-Oriented Programming 
(COOP) [18], with the primary distinction being FOP's avoidance of C++ 
requirements and its broader applicability beyond vtable effects. COOP, 
though mostly a theoretical attack, has shown potential in bypassing CET 
protections [17]. 

The illustrative example in [17] demonstrates the effective use of simple 
functions to exploit a vulnerable Windows application, achieving execution 
by leveraging a favorable trigger function that allows argument control 
and external parameter loading, resulting in a shorter necessary chain. 
In contrast, this paper explores a similar chain entirely within libc, 
without relying on external strings or parameter loading, which leads to 
a larger overall chain.

While previous papers offered glimpses into the implementation of FOP, 
this paper seeks to delve deeper into its utilization within Linux 
environments. By demonstrating that a FOP attack can work solely within 
Glibc, this paper will show that FOP is of use in a modern age of CPU 
protections. This paper will also explore aspects such as gadget 
identification and attack complexity, thereby expanding the scope of 
FOP's application.


----|  3. FOP Gadget Identification

    In any code reuse attack, the effectiveness of the attack framework
heavily relies on the gadgets employed. FOP follows a distinct approach 
to gadget identification, compared to traditional ROP and JOP techniques.

In ROP, identifying gadgets often involves searching for a return 
instruction (0xC3 in x86-64) and tracing backward to uncover useful 
instructions formed by byte combinations. Similarly, in JOP, this process 
involves substituting the return instruction with a jump to a specified 
location or register. However, FOP introduces a departure from this 
conventional method. While it may still be feasible to identify a return 
instruction and backtrack to the beginning of a function, the control 
flow within functions may not always follow a linear path. Instead, it 
may include conditional jumps and loops that alter the flow of execution.

Consequently, FOP necessitates an alternate approach where identification
proceeds forward from a designated starting point. Fortunately, the
protective measures that FOP aims to circumvent introduce landing pad
instructions alongside IBT and Branch Target Identification (BTI). These
landing pad instructions serve as indicators for identifying a starting
position from which to proceed forward during gadget identification.

--------|  3.1 Identification Process

    While pinpointing the starting location of a function marks a crucial
step, it doesn't guarantee that the function can serve as a viable FOP 
gadget. Here, symbolic execution proves invaluable. Symbolic execution 
involves interpreting instructions as logical operations rather than 
executing them outright [13]. This approach enables the traversal of 
potential code paths within a code segment or binary without requiring 
the setup of the exact runtime environment.

Symbolic execution offers distinct advantages, particularly in identifying
potential code paths and defining them through symbols. However, it's not
without its limitations. One significant drawback lies in the possibility 
of traversing paths that may not be feasible in a real-world scenario. 
Because symbolic execution doesn't directly execute code paths, 
comparisons may be misinterpreted, leading to issues like path explosion, 
especially within loops or comparisons.

When a comparison is encountered, symbolic execution can bifurcate the 
code path into two possible branches, potentially leading to an 
exponential increase in the number of traversed paths. This can 
significantly slow down path traversal and exhaust system memory, 
particularly when dealing with code paths containing numerous comparisons, 
loops, or function calls. As we'll explore later, path explosion poses a 
challenge when attempting to identify gadgets with a substantial number of 
instructions. While this may increase the time taken to identify gadgets, 
in most cases, it should not impede the discovery of a sufficient set of 
potential gadgets.

This leads to the crux of this section; a tool designed to identify FOP
gadgets from core dumps was created [14]. This tool leverages a symbolic
execution framework to pinpoint potential FOP gadgets and present them to 
the user. Compatible with both ARM and x86-64 core dumps, the tool 
endeavors to identify FOP gadgets within all executable regions.

Examining the gadget counts below, we observe a considerable number of
gadgets, even with a modest gadget depth of only 15 instructions. In this
table, 'Built' represents software compiled from source, where-as the 
others represent software obtained from Linux distribution repositories. 
Furthermore, 'Depth' represents the max number of instructions analyzed 
beyond each landing pad instruction, indicating gadgets that included a 
return instruction within that depth:

    +-----------------+----------+----------+----------+
    |     Library     | Depth 15 | Depth 25 | Depth 50 |
    +-----------------+----------+----------+----------+
    | Built (x86-64)  |    1426  |     2765 |     5438 |
    | Centos (x86-64) |    1268  |     2618 |     4912 |
    | Ubuntu (x86-64) |    1294  |     2667 |     4897 |
    | Built (ARM)     |    1348  |     2161 |     3298 |
    | OpenSuse (ARM)  |    1320  |     2084 |     3212 |
    +-----------------+----------+----------+----------+

The table above illustrates several tested Glibc versions, comprising
custom-compiled Glibc variants with default compilation parameters, 
alongside the necessary security flags to integrate the discussed 
mitigations. It's important to note that the gadget counts for the Glibc 
versions were measured during the summer of 2023 and may not reflect the 
current environment accurately. This caveat is warranted due to the 
limited availability of identifiable Glibc libraries compiled with BTI 
support for ARM at that time.

Furthermore, it's essential to recognize that the table provided is not 
an exhaustive representation of all the diverse distributions available.

--------|  3.2 Gadget Depth

    In the table above, three examples of gadget depth are displayed. 
Gadget depth refers to the number of instructions examined before 
determining failure if a return instruction is not encountered. The 
values of 15, 25, and 50 have been arbitrarily chosen to illustrate a 
method for categorizing the number of gadgets present in the tested 
libraries. 

In reality, the majority of gadgets may be too complicated or consist of 
too many constraints to be functional or useful; constraints are examined 
in the following section. This leads to the primary point that most useful 
gadgets can be identified within 15 instructions or fewer. These types of 
gadgets typically consist of simple register-setting instructions that 
return early with minimal processing, as illustrated in Section 3.3.

The gadget depth can also be significantly impacted by simple operations. 
For example, the prologue and epilogue of a function can take up nearly 10
instructions, as demonstrated by the first example in Section 3.3.
Instructions like ENDBR64, PUSH, POP, and RET account for 9 of the 15
instructions in the gadget. While these instructions might not ultimately
affect the final state of the environment, as all values are restored, 
they cannot be ignored during gadget identification.

Ultimately the gadget depth is an arbitrary value, similar to the number 
of bytes to look backward in ROP gadgets.

--------|  3.3 Gadget Examples

    This section will provide a few gadget examples to illustrate how 
the tooling displays the gadget and how this translates to the code. All 
examples will be acquired from Glibc 2.39, self-compiled for testing 
purposes, within the Intel architecture. The output will first display 
the tooling output, then will be followed by the assembly code that 
creates this output.

The first example is a simple gadget that sets the register RDI to 1:

```
-------------------------------
libc.so.6 0x139e40:
   Results:
      RAX: 0x1
      RDI: 0x1

0000000000128540 <__nss_files_data_endent>:
  128540:       f3 0f 1e fa   endbr64
  128544:       41 54         push   r12
  128546:       55            push   rbp
  128547:       53            push   rbx
  128548:       48 8b 2d ...  mov    rbp,QWORD PTR [rip+0xb75f1]
  12854f:       48 85 ed      test   rbp,rbp
  128552:       75 0c         jne    128560 <__nss_files_data_endent+0x20>
  128554:       5b            pop    rbx
  128555:       b8 01 00 ...  mov    eax,0x1
  12855a:       5d            pop    rbp
  12855b:       41 5c         pop    r12
  12855d:       c3            ret
-------------------------------
```
<PRE>

As can be found in the assembly above, the gadget would depend on the 
value within [rip+0xb75f1], but as the core file used to create this 
gadget had this value set to 0; this check ultimately failed and this 
path was guaranteed to occur. This results in the RDI register holding 
onto the initially set value of 1.

The following gadget demonstrates the ability to move values between
registers. In this case, the value in the RDI register is transferred 
to  the RSI register:

</PRE>
```
-------------------------------
libc.so.6 0x152510:
   Results:
      RAX: 0x7f309b99c000
      RSI: RDI
-------------------------------
0000000000152510 <_dl_mcount_wrapper_check>:
  152510:       f3 0f 1e fa   endbr64
  152514:       48 8b 05 ...  mov   rax,QWORD PTR [rip+0x84a6d]
  15251b:       48 89 fe      mov   rsi,rdi
  15251e:       48 83 b8 ...  cmp   QWORD PTR [rax+0xa90],0x0
  152525:       00 
  152526:       74 18         je    152540 <_dl_mcount_wrapper_check+0x30>
    ...
  152540:       c3            ret
-------------------------------
```
<PRE>

The final gadget shows an example of the tooling identifying symbolic
restraints to make the gadget successfully pass. In this case, these are
memory constraints to pass a comparison and jump, as well as demonstrating
that parameter based reads and writes occur within this gadget:

</PRE>
```console
-------------------------------
libc.so.6 0x26bb0:
   Results:
      RDI: [RDI]
   Read Constraints:
       0: Qword [RDI]
       1: Dword [16 + RDI]
   Write Constraints:
       2: Dword [16 + RDI] = 0xffffffff + [16 + RDI]
   Jump Constraints:
       Qword [RDI] != 0
       Dword [16 + RDI] != 1
-------------------------------

   26bb5:       53            push   rbx
   26bb6:       48 89 fb      mov    rbx,rdi
   26bb9:       48 83 ec 08   sub    rsp,0x8
   26bbd:       48 8b 3f      mov    rdi,QWORD PTR [rdi]

   26c03:       c3            ret
-------------------------------
```
<PRE>

These gadgets demonstrate a few examples of gadgets that can be found 
within Glibc. They also highlight a feature that has not been directly 
mentioned yet, this being that any function that contains a valid landing 
pad could become a gadget. This means that the function does not need to 
be an exported function but can be Glibc internal functions that a 
programmer may not have knowledge about. One bit of information to note 
is that exported functions `SHOULD` be more likely to contain the needed 
landing pad instruction compared to internal functions.


----|  4. FOP Dispatcher Gadget

    While the abundance of gadgets is noteworthy, their utility is greatly
diminished without a dispatcher. In the context of a FOP attack, a 
dispatcher serves as the orchestrator of our gadgets. Since FOP attacks 
are restricted from modifying the stack to comply with protection schemes, 
a dispatcher becomes essential for managing the loading and execution of 
subsequent  gadgets.

In essence, a dispatcher in FOP resembles those employed in JOP, wherein 
the dispatcher loads a memory location and then jumps to or calls that 
address. However, the primary distinction lies in the dispatcher's need 
to operate within the constraints imposed by existing protections. This 
means refraining from direct jumps to the dispatcher itself, while 
ensuring that landing at a valid landing pad instruction enables effective 
access to the dispatcher. Moreover, the dispatcher must maintain adequate 
control to initiate a FOP attack while adhering to the restrictions 
imposed by these new security measures.

When it comes to identifying dispatcher gadgets, a crucial aspect is 
assessing how the dispatcher utilizes available resources. Specifically, 
this involves analyzing the manipulation of key registers during the 
dispatching process. These key registers typically correspond to the 
calling convention within the architecture and host environment. For 
instance, in Intel architectures these registers include RDI, RSI, RDX, 
and RCX, while in ARM architectures they are R0, R1, R2, and R3.

The same tooling employed for identifying gadgets can also be utilized 
to identify dispatchers. Through this process, it was determined that 
all tested Glibc versions across all architectures contained at least 
one dispatcher that is accessible during normal execution.

One such dispatcher gadget, described below, is located within the
`_dl_call_fini` function. In earlier versions of Glibc, this functionality 
was integrated within `_dl_fini`. However, starting from version 2.37, it 
was separated into its own distinct function. `_dl_call_fini` is typically 
invoked during the exit routines of a binary, either after `exit(0)` has 
been called or when the binary has returned normally from the `main` 
function.

--------|  4.1 _dl_call_fini Dispatcher Gadget

Below is the code snippet extracted from the GLibc 2.39 source code:

</PRE>
```C
void
_dl_call_fini (void *closure_map)
{
  struct link_map *map = closure_map;

  /* Make sure nothing happens if we are called twice.  */
  map->l_init_called = 0;

  ElfW(Dyn) *fini_array = map->l_info[DT_FINI_ARRAY];
  if (fini_array != NULL)
    {
      ElfW(Addr) *array = (ElfW(Addr) *) (map->l_addr
                                          + fini_array->d_un.d_ptr);
      size_t sz = (map->l_info[DT_FINI_ARRAYSZ]->d_un.d_val
                   / sizeof (ElfW(Addr)));

      while (sz-- > 0)
        ((fini_t) array[sz]) ();
    }

  /* Next try the old-style destructor.  */
  ElfW(Dyn) *fini = map->l_info[DT_FINI];
  if (fini != NULL)
    DL_CALL_DT_FINI (map, ((void *) map->l_addr + fini->d_un.d_ptr));
}
```
<PRE>

Indeed, the provided code snippet showcases a 'while' loop that iterates
through an array of function pointers and invokes them, as long as the 
size variable remains greater than zero. To gain insight into the nature 
and location of these values, we can examine the `link_map` structure 
utilized for the map. Below is a truncated version of this structure:

</PRE>
```C
struct link_map
  {
    /* These first few members are part of the protocol with the debugger.
       This is the same format used in SVR4.  */

    ElfW(Addr) l_addr;      /* Difference between the address in the ELF
                                  file and the addresses in memory.  */
    char *l_name;           /* Absolute file name object was found in.  */
    ElfW(Dyn) *l_ld;        /* Dynamic section of the shared object.  */
    struct link_map *l_next, *l_prev; /* Chain of loaded objects.  */

    /* All following members are internal to the dynamic linker.
       They may change without notice.  */

    /* This is an element that is only ever different from a pointer to
       the very same copy of this type for ld.so when it is used in more
       than one namespace.  */
    struct link_map *l_real;

    /* Number of the namespace this link map belongs to.  */
    Lmid_t l_ns;

    struct libname_list *l_libname;
     ElfW(Dyn) *l_info[DT_NUM + DT_THISPROCNUM 
        + DT_VERSIONTAGNUM + DT_EXTRANUM + DT_VALNUM + DT_ADDRNUM];
```
<PRE>

--------|  4.2 link_map Examination

Let's delve into a brief analysis of the expected values and their 
locations within the `link_map` structure.

    1. l_addr: This member typically points to the first page of a
       program's memory. It serves as a reference for accessing various 
       offsets or values within the binary. By keeping track of the main 
       address, programs can efficiently navigate their memory space.

    2. l_info: This member contains an offset pointer that specifies the
       location of data stored within the main program's memory-mapped 
       pages. In conjunction with `l_addr`, it facilitates the 
       determination of the exact address of the structure to which 
       `l_info` points. In this context, `l_info` typically points to 
       the dynamic table, which plays a crucial role during process 
       creation for dynamic allocations and memory loading.

Within the dynamic table two noteworthy fields emerge:

    - DT_FINI_ARRAY: This field points to an array of function pointers
      intended to be executed at the end of program execution.

    - DT_FINI_ARRAY_SZ: As implied, this field denotes the size of the
      `DT_FINI_ARRAY` array.

It is worth noting that these values and pointers are typically located 
in read-only memory within the binary. This is an important consideration, 
as it prevents tampering with these arrays, mitigating potential 
exploitation methods such as the dtors and ctors attacks of the past [15].

To give a very brief explanation of the importance of the `link_map`
structure, I will defer to the few comments within the source, located 
right before this structure definition:

</PRE>
```C
/* 
Structure describing a loaded shared object.  The `l_next' and `l_prev'
members form a chain of all the shared objects loaded at startup.

These data structures exist in space used by the run-time dynamic linker;
modifying them may have disastrous results.

This data structure might change in the future, if necessary.  User-level
programs must avoid defining objects of this type.  
*/
```
<PRE>

The `link_map` structure houses various pointers and registered values
essential for linker operations. As cautioned by the comment, altering 
these values at runtime can lead to dire consequences. Of particular 
significance here is the dynamic access of `l_info` and `l_addr` within 
`_dl_call_fini`. This suggests that modifying either of these values 
provides the capability to influence the location from which the function 
array is accessed. Additionally, adjusting `l_addr` could impact the size 
variable, adding to the potential for manipulation and control.

The alteration of these values holds the potential to seize control of 
program execution. When coupled with the previously identified gadgets, 
such modifications can culminate in complete control over the program, 
akin to the capabilities observed ROP and JOP attacks. An additional 
crucial aspect worth examining is the structure of the loop in memory, 
as this factor can significantly influence the success or failure of a 
FOP attack:

</PRE>
```
    10d4:       49 8d 1c d4             lea    (%r12,%rdx,8),%rbx
    10d8:       0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00    nopl   0x0(%rax,%rax,1)
    10df:       00
    10e0:       ff 13                   call   *(%rbx)
    10e2:       48 89 d8                mov    %rbx,%rax
    10e5:       48 83 eb 08             sub    $0x8,%rbx
    10e9:       49 39 c4                cmp    %rax,%r12
    10ec:       75 f2                   jne    10e0 <_dl_call_fini+0x50>
```
<PRE>

As evident from the provided code snippet, the `dl_fini_array` is loaded 
into RBX at the memory address 0x10d4, positioned towards the end of the 
array and traversed backward. It's essential to highlight that there's no 
direct counter; rather, a comparison occurs between the current index 
(RBX/RAX) and the beginning of the array (R12), followed by an 
unconditional jump without additional checks. Consequently, targeting 
this call loop does not involve modification of any crucial registers, 
thus preserving their integrity.


----|  5. Symbolic Engine

    This section delves deeper into the symbolic engine and the approach 
taken within the tooling. The original tooling was built upon an older 
and currently unsupported framework called pysymemu [19]. Despite its 
lack of updates and support for Python 3, pysymemu was chosen because it 
provided one of the easiest frameworks to understand at a low level, 
allowing for the extraction of necessary functionalities. This included 
updates to incorporate more modern Z3 functionality for symbolic 
expressions.

The tooling relies exclusively on core files for identifying potential
gadgets, which means the core file must include all executable sections.
Normally, core files avoid dumping executable sections to save space, 
assuming that all libraries can be reloaded from memory. To ensure the 
necessary sections are included, the following command can be used to 
include the needed sections from a core dump:

</PRE>
```console
echo 0x37 > /proc/self/coredump_filter
```
<PRE>

</PRE>
The meaning behind 0x37 can be examined in more detail in the core man 
page *man core*. In essence is that this filter includes the ability to 
save file-backed mappings.
<PRE>

Overall, the tooling uses a modified version of this symbolic engine in 
a two-step approach to identifying FOP gadgets.

--------|  5.1 Phase 1: Static Analysis

    The first step involves identifying potential gadgets in an entirely
static manner by walking through potential gadgets until a return 
instruction is found. The starting point of a gadget is marked by the 
ENDBR64 instruction in x64 or the BTI instruction in ARM. If the maximum 
gadget depth is reached before a return instruction is found, the path is 
abandoned, and the next path is examined.

This means that the path identified in this first phase will be the 
required path taken by the symbolic engine in phase 2.

This stage 1 approach of static analysis can also be used for identifying
potential dispatcher gadgets. While the tooling may produce some false
positives due to a less fine-grained examination, it ensures that no 
potential gadgets are overlooked.

--------|  5.2 Phase 2: Symbolic Execution

    In phase 2, the symbolic execution engine is employed to examine each
potential gadget identified in the first stage. The symbolic environment
is set up to closely mirror the running environment based on the core file
used for gadget identification. This involves hosting memory segments and
executable memory space to analyze potential memory accesses or value
transfers. All operations are tracked and reset between examinations of
potential gadgets to ensure accuracy and consistency.

During the symbolic stage, there are several potential termination 
conditions, known as kill states. These include potential infinite loops 
that may have been passed during stage 1. Another example is impossible 
states, such as a memory comparison to a register value within a function. 
Since static analysis lacks knowledge of memory or register values, it may 
result in multiple potential paths being passed to the symbolic engine. If 
the symbolic engine determines that the memory does not currently hold the 
required value, the path may be deemed impossible and terminated.

Impossible paths can also arise when the static engine passes in an 
identified path, which should be a static set of instructions, but during 
the symbolic execution phase, this deviates from the path. This results in 
the engine determining the current path as invalid, as it diverged from 
the expected path identified in phase 1.

While this approach may be inefficient in some aspects, it helps determine
the exact approach taken by a gadget, and confirms that the path taken is 
the correct one. This approach exemplifies the utilization of 
deterministic memory from the core file.

In its current state, the symbolic engine is only designed to handle
deterministic paths, as nondeterministic paths generate more gadgets and 
are less reliable in environments where the memory is known.


----|  6. Examples

    While examples within text may seem mundane to some, for those who
appreciate such illustrations, please stick around! The examples presented
in this paper will now be demonstrated using the custom-built GLibc 2.37
versions utilized for gadget identification earlier. These versions, 
alongside the examples, are attach at the end of this paper in Appendix C 
and where used for identification, along with the entire chains and 
associated code for testing purposes.

The test case involves a straightforward heap vulnerability that grants 
the ability to perform arbitrary memory writes. To demonstrate, a basic 
memory leak scenario is provided, showcasing the semi-arbitrary nature of 
leaking an address within the given menu heap example. Subsequently, upon 
obtaining an arbitrary write capability, the `ld_addr` is overwritten with 
the address of our data on the heap, thereby enabling redirection to the 
desired chain.

Below, Appendix A and B present two FOP chains showcasing the ability to
manipulate registers, memory, and execution state sufficiently to write 
the string "/bin/sh\x00" to memory and execute the `system` function on 
it, within both an Intel and an ARM context.

Additionally, the examples folder within the tooling repository contains
several more examples, such as writing arbitrary shellcode to memory,
`mprotect`-ing the memory range, and then executing the shellcode. 
However, a simple "/bin/sh" shellcode was not included in this paper due 
to the FOP chain length extending into the thousands of gadgets, which 
would not be as visually appealing.

Altogether, the Intel chain comprised of 123 gadgets, 12 of which were 
unique, while the ARM chain consisted of approximately 140 gadgets, of 
which 15 were unique.


----|  7. Final Thoughts

    As illustrated in this paper, FOP emerges as a versatile technique 
poised to potentially succeed and replace ROP and JOP in the code-reuse 
attack landscape. This shift coincides with the integration of modern CPU 
protections such as CET and PAC/BTI, which FOP is capable of defeating.

--------|  7.1 Constraints

    However, despite its capabilities, several caveats must be considered 
when attempting to orchestrate a FOP chain-based attack. Firstly, akin to 
ROP and JOP, initiating a FOP attack necessitates a memory corruption 
vulnerability. This typically requires an arbitrary write capability to 
gain sufficient access to a dispatcher, subsequently pointing to an 
attacker-controlled chain.

Secondly, a memory leak is often imperative, mirroring the prerequisites 
of previous attacks like ROP. With the advent of Address Space Layout
Randomization (ASLR) and Position Independent Executables (PIE), 
circumventing these protections remains a challenge for FOP techniques.

Lastly, perhaps the most significant hurdle lies in the size of FOP 
chains. As these attacks demand more intricate sequences, the chains can 
quickly balloon in size. For instance, the arbitrary shellcode example
referenced in this paper utilizes over 1000 gadgets across both ARM and 
Intel architectures to write just a few dozen bytes to memory. This 
necessity may render the implementation of FOP attacks more arduous 
compared to ROP, which often requires only a handful of gadgets to 
achieve similar objectives.

--------|  7.2 Nomenclature

    When deliberating over the appropriate designation for this technique, 
whether it should be termed FOP or use the previous nomenclature of LOP, 
it seemed prudent to consider the naming conventions of other similar 
techniques. Typically, these names derive from the predominant gadget type 
rather than the specific triggering instance. For instance, JOP is so 
named because its gadgets predominantly utilize jump instructions, rather 
than referring to whether the dispatcher incorporates a jump. Similarly, 
Call Oriented Programming (COP) is named based on the predominant gadget 
type rather than the nature of the throwing instance.

Given this pattern, FOP seems to align with established conventions, 
focusing on the predominant feature of the technique, functional-oriented 
gadgets, rather than the specific throwing instance. However, it's 
important to acknowledge that this is largely a matter of preference and 
interpretation, and opinions may vary on the matter.

--------|  7.3 Architecture Differences

    A noteworthy aspect within the realm of FOP is the comparative
functionality between ARM and Intel architectures. ARM architecture 
boasts greater functionality within FOP when juxtaposed with Intel. 
While this may not be fully evident in the examples provided, as a non 
architecture-dependent approach was taken when considering the important 
registers used in FOP, it is worth noting.

ARM architecture features the R0 register as the first parameter and the
return register, allowing FOP to leverage not only the side-effects of a
function but also its return value. This grants ARM instances an added 
level of versatility in FOP techniques. In contrast, Intel architecture 
lacks this functionality, as the return instruction utilizes the RAX 
register. Consequently, no gadgets were identified to utilize the RAX 
register values in Intel architecture. This discrepancy is logical, given 
that RAX is not designated as a parameter register in the x86_64 
specification, unlike in ARM architecture.

--------|  7.4 Turing Completeness

    Although this paper did not delve into this area, the author believes 
that FOP can achieve Turing completeness given a sufficient set of 
functions in a program. FOP goes beyond conventional function operations 
included within Glibc; it also considers the usage of side effects of 
these functions when assessing the potential Turing completeness of the 
gadget set.

--------|  7.5 Kernel FOP

    While not explored within the confines of this paper, it is worth 
noting that FOP has demonstrated success within kernel instances as well. 
Given the vast array of functions and capabilities within the kernel, it 
is unsurprising that there is an ample supply of gadgets and dispatchers 
to choose from within this domain. The following code excerpt from the 
Linux kernel [16] showcases one such function that could potentially 
serve as a dispatcher gadget, assuming control of RDI and non-zero RSI. 
This scenario is feasible, as heap corruption techniques can often lead 
to primary register control from the outset:

</PRE>
```C
void destroy_params(const struct kernel_param *params, unsigned num)
{
    unsigned int i;

    for (i = 0; i < num; i++)
        if (params[i].ops->free)
            params[i].ops->free(params[i].arg);
}
```
<PRE>

--------|  7.6 Future Work

    In terms of future work, there are several avenues to explore within 
the realm of FOP. While existing tooling can identify FOP gadgets in a 
given instance, there's room for improvement in terms of speed and 
analysis techniques. Additionally, while FOP has been successfully 
demonstrated in Linux environments, there's potential to extend its 
application to other operating systems such as Windows or Apple 
environments.

Given Apple's implementation of PAC and BTI support in newer models of 
their devices, analyzing these techniques may yield valuable insights for 
future exploitation. Investigating the feasibility of utilizing FOP in 
these environments could open up new avenues for code reuse attacks and 
enhance our understanding of modern security protections. Therefore, 
future research efforts could focus on adapting FOP techniques to operate 
effectively within diverse operating system environments, including 
Windows and Apple platforms.

--------|  7.7 Possible Mitigations

    Lastly, there exists the potential to mitigate these techniques. 
While Glibc developers might find it relatively straightforward to 
incorporate PAC authentication to the `link_map` structure on Linux ARM 
instances, it doesn't resolve the underlying issue. Such a patch could 
be circumvented by leveraging potential dispatchers found in a main 
program or secondary libraries to achieve similar effects.

Alternatively, the most effective approach to curtail FOP attacks is to
introduce cleanup instructions at the end of every function. This would
involve zeroing out parameter registers within both Intel and ARM
architectures. For Intel, this shouldn't pose any issues, as parameter
registers are typically volatile and not reused after a function call.
However, with ARM, a potential complication arises with the R0 register, 
as it cannot be zeroed because it contains the return value. 

This may allow potential gadgets to modify R0 and subsequently utilize 
its values within secondary calls to construct operational chains based 
on a single parameter register. While Glibc wasn't determined to contain 
the gadgets to accomplish this, it's not unreasonable to assume that such 
gadgets could exist in the future or in larger code bases. This mitigation 
approach does not protect against using FOP functions as intended, 
particularly when dispatch parameters can be controlled via memory 
corruption. The dispatcher shown in 7.5 is one such example. 

--------|  7.8 Conclusion

    In conclusion, this paper has delved into the nuances of Functional
Oriented Programming (FOP), a technique that shows promise as a successor 
to traditional code reuse attacks such as Return-Oriented Programming 
(ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP). Through comprehensive 
exploration and analysis, we've uncovered the versatility and potential 
of FOP across various architectures, including ARM and Intel. Looking 
ahead, the future of FOP holds opportunities for further research and 
development, with potential applications extending beyond Linux 
environments. As security landscapes evolve and adversaries adapt, 
understanding and addressing the nuances of FOP will be crucial in 
bolstering cyber defense strategies and safeguarding against emerging 
threats.
